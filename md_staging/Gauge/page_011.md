# 3 Radial Gauge

The RadialGauge control can be used for representing a range of values in circular form. It can be used to create sophisticated dashboards, clocks, industrial equipment, medical equipment, more.

## 3.1 Real World Scenarios

A radial gauge evaluates the values of scales and presents them in a radial manner. Radial Gauge enables you to quickly build high quality dashboard, process control, gadget and clocks. Radial gauges consist of important internal domains to present data in a more sophisticated way.

The best example of a radial gauge is a speedometer. The speedometer can be designed to be placed in a racing game application, denoting the speed of a vehicle.
