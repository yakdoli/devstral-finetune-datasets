# Essential Gauge for Windows Forms

## 3.2.1.2 Elaborate Structure of the Control

The RadialGauge control includes the following elements: Scale Label, Needle, Gauge Value, and Background Frame. All the elements are optional for displaying the Gauge control.

### Feature Summary:

Here is a brief overview of various features of the RadialGauge control.

- **Scales**—The scale value can be customized to be displayed within defined limits.
- **Frame types**—Allows you to specify the radial built-in frame style, such as full circle or half circle.
- **Pointers**—Provide complete support for pointers to point the value.
- **Range**—Full-fledged range support.
- **Image and Labels**—Used to customize the appearance of gauge pointer values with user-specified colors and alignment.

## 3.2.2 Concepts and Features

This section illustrates the features of Radial Gauge with images and sample code. It contains the following topics:

- **Radial Gauge Frames**
- **Scales**
- **Ticks**
- **Needles**
- **Ranges**
- **Scaling Divisions**

### 3.2.2.1 Radial Gauge Frame

The frame defines the frame types of radial gauges. Frames can be applied using the FrameType property. The RadialGauge control contains two frame types:

- **Full Circle**
- **Half Circle**

- Keep full signatures, imports/usings, comments, region markers.
- Inline code in text should be wrapped with backticks.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
