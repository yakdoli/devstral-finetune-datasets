# Essential DocIO

A ligature is a combination of characters that is written as a glyph, which is written as though it is a single character. Most often, ligatures are made up of pairs of letters. This enhances readability and attractiveness by providing the best ligature choice for the surrounding text. The OpenType standard specifies four categories of ligatures namely:

- **Standard** - The standard set of ligatures varies by language, but it contains the ligatures that most typographers and font designers agree are appropriate for that language.
- **Contextual** - Contextual ligatures are ligatures that were appropriate for use with that font, but they are not standard.
- **Historical and discretionary** - Historical forms are ligatures that were once standard but are no longer commonly used in the language. They can be used for a “period” effect. Discretionary ligatures are those that the font designer included for specific purposes. In general, you are more likely to want to apply historical or discretionary ligatures to just a portion of your text.
- **All** - All ligature combinations that are available for a font are applied to the text.

## Use Contextual Alternates

Contextual alternates provide fine-tuning of letters or combinations of letters, based on the surrounding characters. This feature can be used to make scripts look more natural and flowing. We can also use contextual alternates to provide specific letter forms at the start or end of a word, next to punctuations, or even at the end of a paragraph.
