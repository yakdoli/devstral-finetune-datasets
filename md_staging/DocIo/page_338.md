### 5.12.3 Bookmarks
Bookmarks identify the location of text in a word document that you can name and identify for future reference. For example, you might use a bookmark to identify text that you want to revise later. Instead of scrolling through the document to locate the text, you can identify the text location by using the **Bookmark** dialog box.
