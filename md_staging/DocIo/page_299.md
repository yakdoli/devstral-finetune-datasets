## 4.8.5 Doc to EPub

EPub is the short form of Electronic Publication; the popular e-book standard by [International Digital Publishing Forum](International Digital Publishing Forum) (IDPF) with the extension .epub. EPub files have reflowable content, which allows the document text display to be optimized based on the reader and device in use.
