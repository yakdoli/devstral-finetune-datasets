## 4.4.1.5 Footnote and Endnote

### Overview
- Footnote and Endnote are two types of notes or references used in documents.  
- Footnotes are placed at the bottom of pages, while Endnotes are collected at the end of sections or works.  
- Both can be distinguished by the superscript numbers they use.  

### Content

#### Footnote
A **Footnote** is a note of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document. It is normally flagged by a superscript number followed by the text where it is referenced to.

#### Endnote
An **Endnote** is a note or reference given at the end of a text or a major text section. Endnotes are similar to footnotes, and the only difference is that they are collected together at the end of a chapter or at the end of work.

#### Adding a Footnote or Endnote
To add a footnote or endnote to a document:
1. Select the text to which you want to apply the footnote or endnote.  
2. Open the **Insert** menu.  
3. Point to **Reference**, and then click **Footnote** in the **Microsoft Word** menu.
