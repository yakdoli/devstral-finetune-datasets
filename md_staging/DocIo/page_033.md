# Essential DocIO

> Note: The WordDocument class represents the Word documents created in memory. This is the memory representation of the Word document written to disk.

1. Add a section to the newly created Word document by using the following code.

```csharp
// Add a new section to the document.
IWSection section = document.AddSection();
```

```vbnet
' Add a new section to the document.
Dim section As IWSection = document.AddSection()
```

2. Add a paragraph to the newly created section in the Word document by using the following code.

```csharp
// Add a new paragraph to the section.
IWPParagraph paragraph = section.AddParagraph();
```

```vbnet
' Add a new paragraph to the section.
Dim paragraph As IWPParagraph = section.AddParagraph()
```

3. Add a paragraph to the newly created section in the Word document by using the following code.

```csharp
// Insert text into the paragraph.
paragraph.AppendText("Hello World!");
```

```vbnet
' Insert text into the paragraph.
paragraph.AppendText("Hello World!")
```

4. Finally, save the Word document. The following code example illustrates how to do this.
