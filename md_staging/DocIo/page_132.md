#### 4.4.1.1 Text Range

The `WTextRange` class represents a piece of text which has separate formatting. You can format the text by using the `CharacterFormat` property. For more details on the `CharacterFormat` property, refer to the CharacterFormat documentation.

You can also use the `AppendText` function of the `WParagraph` class to append text to the paragraph.

**Note:** `AppendText` function appends a new text range to the paragraph with the default character formatting.
