### Notes
**Currently Doc to Html conversion is not supported in Silverlight application.**

### Doc to PDF

**4.8.3 Doc to PDF**

Essential DocIO allows you to export the word document into a PDF document. Use the `ConvertToPDF` method of `DocToPDFConverter` class, to convert the doc to pdf, and save the PDF document. Using this, the user can easily convert the word document to PDF document.

**Note:** You need to have Essential PDF and Essential DocIO installed in your system. Since "Syncfusion.DocToPDFConverter.Base.dll" is conditionally shipped when both DocIO.Base and Pdf.Base is installed.
