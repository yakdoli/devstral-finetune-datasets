## Essential DocIO

[VB]

' Create TextBodySelection and select the items of interest.
Dim textSel As TextBodySelection = New TextBodySelection(sec.Body, 0, lastItemIndex, 0, lastItemIndex)

' Create TextBodyPart and copy the selected items.
Dim replacePart As TextBodyPart = New TextBodyPart(doc)
replacePart.Copy(textSel)

### Find

Essential DocIO provides various methods to improve the flexibility of the Find feature in the Word document.

#### Find Method

Find method is used to find an entry with a specified text or regular expression in the Word document.

Following are the possible input parameters of the Find method.

- **given string to find.**
- **caseSensitive**: defines if replace is case sensitive. For example, if case sensitive is set to false, and you want to find "AA" string, then in such case strings like "aA" and "Aa" also will be returned (will fit the search conditions).
- **wholeWord**: if set to true, string given must be the whole word (not part of the word).

The following are the variants of the Find method.

- **TextSelection Find(string given, bool caseSensitive, bool wholeWord)**: finds and returns an entry of specified string along with formatting, taking into consideration case-sensitive and whole word options.
