### 5.12.9 Comments

Comments are used to include some additional information to a paragraph or text in a word document. Comments can be added and modified whenever needed and deleted when the comment has served its purpose. The comments are very useful when a document is reviewed. You can insert or delete the comments using DocIO and Office Automation.

#### Adding Comments Using MS Office Interop
