# Exporting Header and Footer

## Overview
- Header and Footer in a Word document are useful for placing specific information that is consistently displayed on every page.
- These headers and footers can be exported to an EPub document so that only the first section header appears at the top of the document and the first section footer appears at the end.
- The feature is controlled by turning on the `HtmlExportHeadersFooters` property, which is set to `true` by default.

### Exporting Header and Footer

**Description:**
Header and Footer in the Word document are helpful in placing specific information that has to be displayed on every page. These headers and footers can be exported to the EPub document in such a way that only the first section header would appear at the top of the document and the first section footer would appear at the end of the document. This can be done by turning on `HtmlExportHeadersFooters` property. By default, this property is set to true and hence it always exports header and footer.

#### Code Illustration

The following code illustrates how to export header and footer.

```csharp
[C#]

// Load any .doc or .docx file
WordDocument document = new WordDocument(filename);
```
