### Typographical Spacing

#### Proportional
- Numbers are spaced like letters with varying widths. For example, an 8 is wider than a 1. This makes them easier to read in text.

#### Tabular
- Each number has the same width, ensuring that numbers in a column are vertically aligned. This is particularly useful in Mathematics and financial information for readability.

### Number Forms

#### Default
- The default number form is determined by the font designer for each font.

#### Lining
- Lining numbers have the same height and do not extend below the baseline. They are easier to read in tables, boxes, or forms.

#### Old-style
- In Old-style numbering, character lines flow above or below the text line, making the numbers easier to read. Some numbers like 3 and 5 may extend below the baseline or be centered higher on the line.

### Stylistic Sets

#### Overview
- Stylistic sets help users change the appearance of text by applying different styles. A font designer can include up to 20 stylistic sets, each affecting a subset of the font's characters.

#### Example with Gabriola Font
- The open type font Gabriola supports seven stylistic sets, each affecting the text formatting.

##### Text Samples with Stylistic Sets
- **Default** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 1** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 2** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 3** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 4** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 5** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 6** - The quick red fox.
- **Stylistic set 7** - The quick red fox.
