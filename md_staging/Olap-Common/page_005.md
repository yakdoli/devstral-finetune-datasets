# 1 Business Intelligence (BI)

## Overview
- This section defines Business Intelligence (BI), emphasizes its importance, and discusses recent advancements in BI technologies.
- It highlights the use of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) as the standard for persisting and accessing BI data.
- It covers the evolution of BI implementation costs and introduces Microsoft's SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) as a cost-effective OLAP solution.

### 1.1 What is BI?
Business Intelligence (BI) simplifies information to enable all decision makers of an organization to access information easily. This helps the decision makers at all levels to understand, analyze, collaborate, and act on information anytime, anywhere.

Here is how Wikipedia defines [BI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence).

### 1.2 Why to use BI?
It is hard to overemphasize the importance of Business Intelligence (BI) in today's world. It is impossible to make strategic business decisions without analyzing the past business performance. Businesses are increasingly investing heavily in tools and services that let decision makers visually analyze data in myriad ways.

Several products and solutions have emerged to cater to the Business Intelligence market. Lessons have been learned, and currently Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is the de facto standard for persisting and accessing BI data. Applications built using OLAP include sales reports, executive reports, forecasting, and so on.

### 1.3 What's new in BI?
While BI has been an expensive affair in the past, requiring several thousands of dollars in investment for integrating a solution into an enterprise, recent technological developments have considerably reduced the cost to implement and own an OLAP-based BI solution.

Microsoft's SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) is one such solution, which is a set of OLAP services provided as part of Microsoft SQL Server. The SSAS is available for almost a decade, is a mature, very cost-effective solution for maintaining multidimensional (also called cube) data. With an efficient OLAP storage mechanism in place, you only need another efficient OLAP visualization tool set to complete your BI needs. This is where Syncfusion OLAP controls come into place.

#### 1.3.1 Multi-dimensional Data
Multi-dimensional structure is defined as "a variation of the relational model that uses multidimensional structures to organize data and express the relationships between data." The structure is broken into cubes which are able to store and access data within the confines of each cube. Each cell within a multidimensional structure contains aggregated data related to elements along each of its dimensions. Even when data is manipulated, it is still easy to access as well as be a compact type of database. The data still remains interrelated. Multidimensional structure is quite popular for analytical databases that use OLAP applications. Analytical databases use these databases because of their ability to deliver answers quickly to complex business queries. Data can be seen through different ways, which gives a broader picture of a problem unlike other models.
