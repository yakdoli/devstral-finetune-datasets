# Essential OlapCommon

## Overview
- Multi-dimensional database products are popularized as OLAP systems for decision support on large historical data.
- Provides a multidimensional view of data with categorical and numeric attributes forming dimensions and measures, respectively.
- Supports hierarchical aggregation and interactive exploration of data cubes.

## Content

### Core Concepts
- **OLAP Systems**: Facilitate decision support by exposing a multidimensional view of data.
- **Multidimensional View**:
  - Categorical attributes (e.g., Products, Stores) form dimensions.
  - Numeric attributes (e.g., Sales, Revenue) form measures or cells of the multidimensional cube.
- **Hierarchies**:
  - Dimensions are associated with hierarchies that define aggregation levels.
  - Example: store-name -> city -> state for the Store dimension.
- **Aggregation**:
  - Measure attributes are aggregated using functions like sum, average, count, and variance.
  - Aggregation is performed at various levels of detail based on combinations of dimension attributes.

### Data Exploration Tools
- **Navigational Operators**:
  - Provide tools for exploring data cubes using operations such as select, drill-down, roll-up, and pivot.
- **Interactive Analysis**:
  - Analysts can interactively explore data by invoking sequences of operations.
  - Visualization of measures across various combinations of dimensions and aggregation levels.

### Syncfusion's OLAP Architecture
- Offers the easiest way to perform extreme analysis of data.
- Aligns with the multidimensional view and interactive exploration needs.
