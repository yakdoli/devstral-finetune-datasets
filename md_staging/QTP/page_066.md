# Docking Manager

- When two controls are in tabbed style and you click on the inactive tab and drag it outside the tabbed mode, it will not replay properly. In order to avoid this problem, select the tab that is going to be dragged, click on the tab, and drag it outside.
- When a floating form state is changed to an MDIChild state and MDIChild state is changed to a floating form state, it will not replay properly.

## Ribbon Control

The Quick access panel customize menu will not be recorded.
