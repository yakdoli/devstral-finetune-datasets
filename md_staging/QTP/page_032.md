# Essential QuickTest Professional

## Overview
- Demonstrates the behavior of a default recording without recognizing Syncfusion controls.
- Highlights the interactions with various cell types, such as checkbox, pushbutton, password, and currency cells, within the GridControl.
- Explains how the recorded actions may not fully capture the functionality of Syncfusion-specific controls.

### Understanding Default Recording in QuickTest Professional

The image above showcases the behavior of the QuickTest Professional tool when recording interactions with a GridControl that contains various Syncfusion-specific controls. The expert view on the top half of the image shows the resultant script generated by the tool:

```plaintext
1. SwfWindow("GridControl").Move 414,308
2. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfObject("gridControl1").Click 321,313
3. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfEditor("SwfEditor").SetCaretPos 0,0
4. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfObject("gridControl1").Click 344,61
5. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfEditor("SwfEditor").SetCaretPos 0,0
6. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfEditor("SwfEditor").Type "hrhrhy"
7. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfObject("gridControl1").Click 99,254
8. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfEdit("SwfEdit").SetSecure "4ab06ef0588b07eb464dc06d7bea069c"
9. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfObject("gridControl1").Click 151,258
10. SwfWindow("GridControl").SwfEdit("SwfEdit").SetSecure "4ab06ef0643014756206f225d00f02d5096773a8cca3c31
11. SwfWindow("GridControl").Move 386,364
```

#### Key Observations:
- The script includes mouse clicks at specific coordinates and attempts to interact with `SwfEditor` and `SwfEdit` controls.
- The actions involve setting caret positions and entering secured text, indicative of interactions with password fields or secure input areas.

#### GridControl Layout and Interaction Points:
The bottom half of the image depicts the GridControl interface, which contains various cell types:

| Row | Description                           | Example                             |
|-----|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3   | CheckBox Cells                       | A checkbox is marked in column C. |
| 7   | PushButton Cells                     | Includes "PushButton 1" and "PushButton 2". |
| 10  | Password Cells                       | Displays masked input represented by `******`. |
| 13  | Currency Cells                       | Displays formatted currency values like `$456.00` and `($739.00)`. |
| 16  | MaskEdit Cells                       | Contains formatted editing examples such as `(449-091-11)` and `( -- )`. |

### Importance of Recognizing Syncfusion Controls

Syncfusion controls offer enhanced functionality beyond standard Windows Forms controls. When QTP does not recognize these controls, the generated scripts may not accurately capture all the rich functionalities or properProcesses. This defaults to a more general approach, potentially leading to incomplete or inefficient test automation.

### Conclusion

The figure illustrates that without explicit recognition of Syncfusion controls, the test script may fall back on generic event handling, leading to a compromised simulation of genuine user interactions. Proper integration of Syncfusion controls into test automation frameworks ensures more accurate and effective test coverage.

## API Reference (if applicable)

This page does not provide specific API references, but the actions depicted involve interaction with the following:
- `SwfWindow`
- `SwfObject`
- `SwfEditor`
- `SwfEdit`

For more detailed API information, refer to the Syncfusion documentation specific to GridControl and related controls.

## Code Examples

The script provided in the expert view represents typical interaction recorded by QuickTest Professional. However, utilizing Syncfusion-specific APIs would provide more accurate and robust test automation capabilities.
