## Content

### Editing in Keyword View – Right-click

#### Overview
The figure illustrates the process of editing actions using the "Keyword View" in the QuickTest Professional interface. It focuses on the manipulation of grid control objects via right-click actions like cutting, copying, and pasting.

#### Detailed Description
- **Figure 24: Editing in Keyword View – Right-click**
  - The figure displays the QuickTest Professional environment with a focus on the grid control actions and values. The right-click menu options for a selected grid control are highlighted, allowing for actions such as Cut, Copy, and Paste.
  
  - The grid columns show:
    - **Value**: Numeric and alphanumeric values associated with grid control entries.
    - **Documentation**: Summary descriptions, with many entries marked as "<No documentation summary is available for this...>".

#### Example Workflow
For example, clicking **Cut** in the menu will cause the row representing a user-action to be removed. You can then right-click on any other item and click **Paste** on the menu displayed. This causes the row to be pasted before the right-clicked item.
