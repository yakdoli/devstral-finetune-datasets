### Box Plots

#### Figure 233: Series 1 ZOrder = 0, Series 2 ZOrder = 1

The first chart represents a box plot with two series. Series 1 has a ZOrder of 0, and Series 2 has a ZOrder of 1. The plot demonstrates how the series are layered with Series 2 appearing above Series 1. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 80, and the y-axis is categorical, ranging from 1 to 7.

#### Figure 234: Series 1 ZOrder = 1, Series 2 ZOrder = 0

The second chart shows a box plot where the ZOrder of Series 1 is set to 1, and the ZOrder of Series 2 is set to 0. This arrangement places Series 1 above Series 2. The layout and axis details are consistent with the first chart, maintaining the x-axis range of 0 to 80 and the y-axis from 1 to 7.

### Rearranging the Series using ZOrder property

The section explains how to rearrange the order of series in a chart using the **ZOrder property**. By adjusting the ZOrder values of individual series, users can control the visual stacking of the series within the chart. This feature is valuable for enhancing the clarity and focus of specific data within complex visualizations.
