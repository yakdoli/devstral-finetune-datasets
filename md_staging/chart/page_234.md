### Product Comparison with FunnelMode as "Height"

**Figure 135:** The funnel chart is depicted with varying heights corresponding to different product comparison metrics. Each section represents a data point, and the heights are indicated by numerical values (25.3, 45.7, 97.3, 20.6, 125.8, 216.1). The colorful segments differentiate the data points.

### Product Comparison with FunnelMode as "Width"

**Figure 136:** This funnel chart illustrates the "Width" mode, where the widths of the sections correspond to the data points. Similar to the previous figure, each section is color-coded to differentiate the data points (25.3, 45.7, 97.3, 20.6, 125.8, 216.1).
