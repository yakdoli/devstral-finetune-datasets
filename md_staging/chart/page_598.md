### Essential Chart for Windows Forms

#### Figure 363: Grouped Data with Filtering

The chart titled **"Essential Chart-Chart Data Filtering"** displays:

- **X-axis**: Representing **Time (hr)** with intervals from 0 to 8.
- **Y-axis**: Representing **Network Load** with values ranging from 0 to 600.
- Each bar in the chart corresponds to a time interval, showing fluctuations in network load over time.
- The chart utilizes an orange bar color, labeled as the "Filter Series."

#### Essential Grid Interaction

Essential Chart offers great interaction capabilities with **Essential Grid**. You can use a common data model for the grid and chart. The grid can also serve as a data model for the chart, as shown in the following image. Selected columns are automatically mapped into the chart. All it takes is a few lines of code to implement a model that adapts the data in question (in this case grid cells) for display in the chart.
