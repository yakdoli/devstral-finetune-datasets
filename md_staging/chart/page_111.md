### Adding Step Area Series to the Chart

Step Area series can be added to the chart using the following C# code:

```csharp
// Create chart series and add data points into it.
ChartSeries series = this.chartControl1.Model.NewSeries("Series Name", ChartSeriesType.StepArea);
series.Points.Add(0, 1);
series.Points.Add(1, 3);
series.Points.Add(2, 4);
series.Points.Add(3, 2);
series.Points.Add(4, 3);

// Add the series to the chart series collection.
```

### Notes

- The chart series is created with a specified name and type as `StepArea`.
- Data points are added to the series using the `Points.Add` method.
- The series is then added to the chart's series collection.

## Additional Information

Step Area Series is a visualization technique used to represent data trends over time. It features vertical lines connecting data points, forming stepped areas that make it easier to compare data across different categories or time periods.
