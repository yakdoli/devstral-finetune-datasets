# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates placing x and y-axes in an opposed position to their default implied position.
- Explains how to configure custom axes and their properties.
- Describes the use of multiple axes in a chart for plotting.
- Provides guidance on implementing right-to-left cultures using axes settings.
- Includes steps to add a new axis to a chart.

### Axes Positioning

```csharp
// default left position
Me.chartControl1.PrimaryYAxis.OpposedPosition = True
```

The above code snippet will place both the x and y-axes in the position opposite to their default implied position.

You can similarly set this property on any custom `ChartAxis` that you might add to the chart. Using multiple axes in a chart is described in this topic: [Multiple Axes](#multiple-axes).

The OpposedPosition along with Inversed setting could be useful for implementing charts for right-to-left cultures.

#### 4.6.4 Multiple Axes

Often you will have to plot multiple series on a single chart, each in its own x or y axis. You will then need to add an x or y axis to the chart in addition to the already existing PrimaryXAxis and PrimaryYAxis. You can do this by instantiating a `ChartAxis` and adding it to the `Axes` collection. Then specify the newly created axis as the x or y axis of a particular series.

The following are the steps to include a new axis to the chart.
