### Funnel Chart with Data-Bound Labels

- **Figure 198**: Funnel Chart with Data-Bound Labels
  - A funnel chart visually represents the flow of data through several stages. Each section of the funnel corresponds to a different category, and the size of the section reflects the value associated with that category.
  - **Data Categories**:
    - Los Angeles: 13
    - London: 6
    - Tokyo: 17
    - Houston: 15
    - New York: 11

- **Description**:
  - The funnel chart in Figure 198 is an example of how to use data-bound labels in a funnel chart. Each stage of the funnel is labeled with a city name and its corresponding value. The color coding on the left side of the chart indicates the value for each city, helping to visually compare the data across stages.
