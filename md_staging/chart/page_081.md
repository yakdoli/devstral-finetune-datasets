# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Bar Chart is a versatile statistical diagram used for comparison and visualization of data across categories.
- Displays horizontal bars and can accommodate 3D effects.
- Suitable for comparing items at single points in time or tracking variations over time.

## Bar Chart Description
Bar Chart is the simplest and most versatile of statistical diagrams. It displays horizontal bars for each point in the series and points from adjacent series are drawn as bars next to each other. It is also available with a 3D visual effect. Bar Charts can be used to compare values across categories, for showing the variations in the value of an item over time or for showing the values of several items at a single point in time.

Another good reason to use bar charts is when you realize that the number of a data series fits better in a horizontal format. If you have long gaps between different values and you also have many items to compare, the bar chart type is the best one to use.

### Example
