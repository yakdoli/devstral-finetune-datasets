Dim exportFileName As String = fileName & ".pdf"
Dim file As String = fileName & ".gif"

'Add a page to the empty PDF document
pdfDoc.Pages.Add()

'Draw chart image in the first page
pdfDoc.Pages(0).Graphics.DrawImage(PdfImage.FromFile(file), New Point(10, 30))

'Save the PDF Document to disk.
pdfDoc.Save(exportFileName)

## 4.15 Design time Features

The design time features are discussed in the below topics:

### 4.15.1 Chart Templates

Essential Chart provides support to save the series and point properties as an XML file. This enables you to save the series and point properties into chart templates and load the chart templates into the Chart control when needed.

#### Use Case Scenarios

When you want to create charts with a consistent look and feel, you can utilize this feature. You can load the saved chart source to achieve this.
