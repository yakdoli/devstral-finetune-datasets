The Wizard window titled "Data Source Configuration Wizard" includes the following:

- **Choose Your Data Connection**
  - **Which data connection should your application use to connect to the database?**
    - A dropdown list box with the default connection string:
      ```
      ACCESS.C:\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\7.1.0.5\Windows\Chart.Windows\Sample
      ```
    - **New Connection...** button to create a new data connection.
    - A warning note about storing sensitive data:
      ```
      This connection string appears to contain sensitive data (for example, a password), which is required to connect to the database. However, storing sensitive data in the connection string can be a security risk. Do you want to include this sensitive data in the connection string?
      ```
      - **No, exclude sensitive data from the connection string. I will set this information in my application code.**
      - **Yes, include sensitive data in the connection string.**
    - **Connection string** text box for additional details.

- **Navigation Buttons**
  - **< Previous**
  - **Next >**
  - **Finish**
