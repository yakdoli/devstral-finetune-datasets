### 4.4.9.2 Radar Chart

Radar Chart is the clock face form of a line chart. It represents each data series as a line around a central point. The category $(x)$ variable is plotted at equally spaced points around the clock. The $y$ variable is plotted as a radius, so each category has its own $y$-axis radiating from the center.

#### Some scenarios where this chart type could be used
- When you want to compare the aggregate values of a number of data series.
- Graphically display the differences between actual and ideal performance, thereby using this chart to define performance and identifying strengths and weaknesses.
- This is also an ideal chart to use when the categories have a natural cyclic order, for example, seasons of the year.
- Radar charts supports plotting the axis values in the reverse direction / clockwise direction also, by setting the **Inversed** property of axis to **true**.
