## Essential Chart for Windows Forms

### 4.13.2 Import Data from XML to a Chart

There is no built-in support in Chart for importing data from an XML file. But given a corresponding XSLT file, the XML data can be converted into a DataSet, which can then be bound to the chart easily. This is illustrated in this sample that is distributed with the installation:

### 4.13.3 Import Data from Excel to Chart

There is no built-in support in Chart for importing data from XLS (MS Excel) files. But this can be easily accomplished by using the "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0" to first convert it into a DataSet and then bind it to the chart. This is illustrated in this sample that is distributed with the installation:
