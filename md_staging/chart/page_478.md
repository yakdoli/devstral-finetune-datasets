## Content

### Product Comparison Chart

Figure 308 illustrates the Product Comparison Chart, where **Product B Series** is being highlighted. The chart compares three products (Product A, Product B, and Product C) based on their **Capacity (Tones)** and **Range (Miles)**.

#### 4.9.4.1 Drawing Interactive Cursor Separately – Either Horizontally or Vertically or Both

An **Interactive cursor** is used to indicate the x-axis and y-axis values of a data point. It can be drawn in different orientations: **Horizontal**, **Vertical**, or in both directions. The cursor's color can also be customized according to requirements. The default color is set initially and can be changed based on orientation, or a common color can be used for both orientations.

#### Use Case Scenarios

The purpose of using the Chart Interactive Cursor is to indicate the x-axis and y-axis values for a specified data point. This allows you to accurately locate the position of the point on the axes. You can use the cursor as needed: either **horizontally**, **vertically**, or in both orientations.

The following screenshot shows the Interactive cursor, which is drawn in horizontal orientation.
