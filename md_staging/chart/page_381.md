**Note:** Indexing is supported only on the x-axis in Essential Chart.

You can enable x-axis indexing or categorizing through the `Indexed` property of the `ChartControl` as shown below:

#### Code Examples

- **C#**

```csharp
this.chartControl1.Indexed = true;
```

- **VB.NET**

```vb
Me.chartControl1.Indexed = True
```

The above property automatically affects all the x-axes in the chart.
