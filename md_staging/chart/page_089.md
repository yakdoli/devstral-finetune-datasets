### Histogram Definition and Characteristics
Histogram is a bar (column) chart of a frequency distribution in which the widths of the bars are proportional to the classes into which the variable has been divided, and the heights of the bars are proportional to the class frequencies. The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent. In addition, the chart has the capability to draw a normal distribution curve.

### Utility of Histograms
Histograms are useful data summaries that convey the following information:
- The general shape of the frequency distribution. (normal, exponential, etc.)
- Symmetry of the distribution and whether it is skewed.
- Modality - unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.
The shape of the distribution conveys important information such as the probability distribution of the data.

### Summary
- **Purpose**: Histograms effectively summarize and visualize frequency distributions.
- **Features**: Adjacent classes, proportional bar heights, and support for normal distribution curves.
- **Uses**: Conveying shape, symmetry, and modality of data distributions.
