### **4.4.7.8 Box And Whisker Chart**

In 1977, John Tukey published an efficient method for displaying a five-number data summary. The graph is called a Box and Whisker plot (also known as BoxPlot) and summarizes the following statistical measures.

- **median**
- **upper and lower quartiles (75 percentile to 25 percentile)**
- **minimum and maximum data values**

The following is an example of a Box and Whisker plot.

The Box and Whisker plot is interpreted as follows.

- The box itself contains the middle 50% of the data. The upper edge (hinge) of the box indicates the 75th percentile of the data set and the lower hinge indicates the 25th percentile. The range of the middle two quartiles is known as the inter-quartile range.
- The line in the box indicates the median value of the data.
- Box and Whisker chart has two modes, Normal mode and Percentile mode.
