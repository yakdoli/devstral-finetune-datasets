## Chart Control Overview

Essential chart supports the implementation of Polar and Radar charts in the chart control. These charts can be used to display different values and angles in the form of a graph.

### 4.4.9.1 Polar Chart

A Polar Chart is a circular graph on which data is displayed, in terms of values and angles. The x values define the angles at which the data points will be plotted. The y value defines the distance of the data points from the center of the graph, with the center of the graph usually starting at 0.

It is a form of graph that allows a visual comparison between several quantitative or qualitative aspects of a situation and also allows a visual comparison between several situations that are drawn using the same axes (poles).

Polar charts support plotting the axis values in the reverse direction / clockwise direction also, by setting the **Inversed** property of the axis to **true**.
