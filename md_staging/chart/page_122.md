## 4.4.6.1 Scatter Chart

Scatter Charts, also known as XY Charts, are a plot of y values and x values along the two axes. The points are not joined together and can be customized using shapes or images to make them easily identifiable, usually independent of time.

The scatter graph lets you plot data points based on two independent variables. The variable that we seek to predict is called the dependent variable or **y-variable**. The variable on which it depends is called the independent variable or the **x-variable**. Scatter graphs can chart multiple data sets, each represented by a different symbol and each having any number of data points.

It is used to display numerical data, either discrete or continuous. Scatter charts are commonly used for visualizing scientific data.
