### 4.4.3 Column Charts
Column Charts are among the most commonly used chart types. Displayed in vertical bars (called columns), they depict the different values of one or more items. Points from adjacent series are drawn as bars next to each other. They are ideal for showing the variations in the value of an item over time.

A very similar bar type is the **Bar Charts** type where the bars are rendered horizontal.

Essential Chart supports these different Column Charts.
