##### Zooming via Mouse

Essential Chart supports interactive zooming features along the \( x \) and \( y \) axis. During runtime, the user can simply select the range he wants to zoom with the mouse, and the chart will accordingly zoom-in. Scrollbars will be activated to browse the areas that become hidden on zooming in.

Enable Zooming via the `EnableXZooming` and `EnableYZooming` properties.
