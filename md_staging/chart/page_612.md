# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## 4.19.6 LayoutCompleted Event

This event is handled every time a resizing of the chart is caused and when the chart re-renders itself. Listening to this event helps in cases where you render custom images over the chart or position custom controls over the chart.

### Code Example: C#

```csharp
[C#]

private static void chartControl1_LayoutCompleted(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Layout Completed event is raised");
}
```

### Code Example: VB.NET

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

Private Sub chartControl1_LayoutCompleted(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Console.WriteLine("Layout Completed event is raised")
End Sub
```

## 4.19.7 ChartAreaPaint Event

ChartAreaPaint event is discussed in **Custom Drawing**.
