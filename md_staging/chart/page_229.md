# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Displays the project cost breakdown using funnel charts.
- Demonstrates funnel charts with different configurations: "Figure Base = 'Circle'" and standard base.

## Content

### Funnel Chart with Figure Base = "Circle"

#### Project Cost Breakdown Chart
The chart visualizes the breakdown of project costs using a funnel graph. Each segment represents a different cost category, with the size of the segment reflecting the proportionate cost. Here is the detailed breakdown:

1. **Base category (25.3)**: Represented by a gray segment.
2. **Second category (45.7)**: Represented by a light blue segment.
3. **Third category (97.3)**: Represented by a red segment.
4. **Fourth category (20.6)**: Represented by a green segment.
5. **Fifth category (125.8)**: Represented by a yellow segment.
6. **Top category (216.1)**: Represented by a dark blue segment.

**Figure:**
- A funnel chart with a circular base is displayed, showing each cost category as a distinct segment.
- The size of the segments decreases from bottom to top, illustrating the flow and distribution of project costs.

### Standard Funnel Chart

#### Project Cost Breakdown Chart
This section presents the same project cost breakdown but with a standard funnel chart configuration.

1. **Base category (25.3)**: Represented by a gray segment.
2. **Second category (45.7)**: Represented by a light blue segment.
3. **Third category (97.3)**: Represented by a red segment.
4. **Fourth category (20.6)**: Represented by a green segment.
5. **Fifth category (125.8)**: Represented by a yellow segment.
6. **Top category (216.1)**: Represented by a dark blue segment.

**Figure:**
- A standard funnel chart is displayed, showing each cost category as a distinct segment.
- The size of the segments decreases from bottom to top, similar to the first chart.

**Figure: Project Cost Breakdown**
- A funnel chart layout with straight-edged segments is illustrated, providing an alternative view of the same data.
