## Overview
- Explains indexed X values in line charts.
- Discusses cases where the X values in a series are meaningless and represent categories.
- Describes how to use positional values instead of actual X-values in a chart.

### 4.6.1 Indexed X Values

By default, points in a series are plotted against their x and y values. However, in some cases, the x values are meaninglessâ€”they simply represent categories, and you do not want to plot the points against such x values. Such an x-axis that ignores the x-values and simply uses the positional value of a point in a series is said to be Indexed.

In the figure below, the first chart shows a line chart that is not-indexed while the second chart shows a line chart whose x-axis is indexed.
