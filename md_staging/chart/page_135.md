### 4.4.7.5 Point and Figure Chart

**Point and Figure Chart is used to identify support levels, resistance levels and chart patterns. The chart ignores the time factor and concentrates solely on movements in price - a column of Xs or Os may take one day or several weeks to complete. By convention, the first X in a column is plotted one box above the last O in the previous column (and the first O in a column is plotted one box below the highest X).**

This is a chart that plots the day-to-day increment and decrement in price. It uses a series of Xs and Os to determine price trends where the Xs represent an upward trend and the Os represent a downward trend. The default value of `ReversalAmount` is 1. Use the `PriceUpColor` to specify the color for the Xs and `PriceDownColor` to specify the color for the Os.
