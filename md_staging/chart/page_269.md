# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates the visual differences between charts rendered with different light angles and 3D effects in the .NET WinForms application.
- Two charts are shown, each with a different light angle setting, highlighting how each configuration impacts the appearance of the 3D chart.
- The charts visualize "Task finished (%)" over "Daily Review" categorized by six daily intervals.

## Content

### Chart 1: Light Angle = 45 with 3D Effect

*Figure 159: Light Angle = 45 with 3D Effect*

This chart displays the task completion percentages across five daily reviews. The light angle is set to 45 degrees, contributing to a pronounced 3D effect, enhancing the visual depth and clarity of the bar blocks.

### Chart 2: Light Angle = 30 with 3D Effect

*Figure 160: Light Angle = 30 with 3D Effect*

This chart also shows task completion percentages across five daily reviews, but with a light angle of 30 degrees. This setting produces a less intense 3D effect compared to the previous chart, providing a softer appearance for the bars.
