# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## 4.12 Statistical Formulas

Essential Chart comes with support for several Statistical formulas that will let you apply formulas on data points in one or more series and will help you analyze and arrive at meaningful information from those data points.

These formulas are mainly exposed via static methods from the `BasicStatisticalFormulas` and `UtilityFunctions` types.

### 4.12.1 Basic Statistical Formulas

Some commonly used statistical formulas that you can apply on the series points are exposed via static methods in the `BasicStatisticalFormulas` type.

| Statistical Formulas                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Anova Test**                      | An ANOVA test is used to test the differences between the means of two or more groups of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Correlation**                     | The Correlation formula shows how strong the relation is between two random variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Covariance**                      | The Covariance formula measures the degree of dependence between two random variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **F-Test**                          | An F-test is any statistical test in which, the test statistic has an F-distribution if the null hypothesis is **true**.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Mean**                            | This formula returns the average, or mean, of data stored in a data series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Standard Deviation**              | This formula returns the Standard Deviation within a group of data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **T Test with Equal Variances**     | Perform a T Test using Student's distribution (T distribution) with equal variances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **T Test Paired**                   | Performs a T Test using Student's distribution (T distribution) with paired samples. This is useful when there is a natural pairing of observations in                                       |
