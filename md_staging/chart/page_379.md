## 4.6 Chart Axes

An axis in Essential Chart is represented by the **ChartAxis** class. The axes are stored in the Chart control's **Axes** collection.

The **PrimaryXAxis** is usually rendered at the bottom, horizontally, while the **PrimaryYAxis** is usually rendered at the left, vertically. There might be exceptions to this rule as in the case of a Bar chart where the above x and y axis positions are reversed.
