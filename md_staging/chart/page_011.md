# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview

This section covers information on Essential Chart control, its key features, prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers, and finally the documentation details complimentary with the product. It comprises the following sub-sections:

### 1.1 Introduction to Essential Chart

Essential Chart is an easily configurable, presentation quality business chart control. A unique point-based Styles Architecture, easily extensible Data Model, easily extendable rendering model, native Date Handling, and a unique Shared Data Model are the features that distinguish Essential Chart. This control has been created using C#, which means that it is a fully-managed .NET component, and has been specifically designed for use with Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET.

Essential Chart for Windows Forms is a perfect solution for developers looking to add advanced, feature-rich, visually appealing charts to their Windows Forms applications. The product comes with numerous samples as well as an extensive documentation to guide you every step of the way.

Chart is used as a means to show the graphical representation of two values. For Example, a Line Chart can be used in health Statistic reports, in which it can show the rates over time or for a series of values, such as age-specific death rates. Logarithmic charts can be used in Share price charts where we plot between price and time. In logarithmic charts, we can identify the 'Proportional change in price' with respect to the 'Change in time'. We use 'Proportional change in price' to observe market sentiment. Market participants move share prices either up or down proportionally depending on how bullish or bearish they feel.
