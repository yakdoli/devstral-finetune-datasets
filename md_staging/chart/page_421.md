## Rendering Chart in 3-D Style

The interior walls of 3-D charts are enhanced with color effects to improve the chart appearance for many 3-D chart types such as column, column range, bar, area, spline area, step area, candle, and histogram. The chart can be rendered in 3-D style using the **Style3D** property. The following table explains this property.

### Property Table

| Property  | Description                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Style3D   | Specifies whether the chart should be rendered in 3-D style. |

The following code example shows how to enable rendering the chart in 3-D style.

### Code Example

```csharp
this.chartControl1.Style3D = true;
```

```vb.net
Me.chartControl1.Style3D = True
```
