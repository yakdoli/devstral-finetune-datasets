# Essential Chart for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses different types of pie charts and their visual representations in the Essential Chart for Windows Forms.
- Includes examples of a standard pie chart, a pie bevel chart, and a pie inside chart.
- Emphasizes the design and structure of these chart types for visualization purposes.

## Content

### Pie Chart Examples

#### Figure 171: Pie Chart
- A standard pie chart divided into three segments: one red, one blue, and one orange.
- On the right side, a legend displaying the three colored segments, indicating their respective proportions.
- Visually, the pie chart is presented in a 3D format with shading, giving it depth and enhancing its visual appeal.

#### Figure 172: Pie Bevel Chart
- A pie bevel chart similar to the standard pie chart in structure but with a distinct flat top surface.
- This chart also consists of three segments: red, blue, and orange.
- The bevel effect provides a flat top, which can make the chart appear less three-dimensional compared to the standard pie chart.

#### Figure 173: Pie Inside Chart
- A pie inside chart with a three-dimensional appearance, similar to the standard pie chart.
- It features segments in red, blue, and orange, mirroring the proportions as shown in the legend.
- The inside chart provides a slightly different perspective on the three-dimensional format, enhancing the visual depth and detail.

### Additional Context

- The page uses various chart types to demonstrate the visual customization options available within the Essential Chart for Windows Forms.
- These charts are likely used to represent data distributions or proportions in a visually intuitive manner.

## Code Examples

- While not directly shown in this image, typical code examples for generating these charts would involve using the `Syncfusion.Chart` namespace and properties such as `Pie3DChart`, `BevelPieChart`, and layout adjustments specific to each chart type.
