### WinForms-specific conventions

- Prefer C# samples when language is ambiguous; if VB is explicitly shown, keep both.
- Treat control names, namespaces, and types exactly (e.g., `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabControlAdv`, `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid`).
- Distinguish design-time vs runtime features; preserve property grids, designer steps, and menu paths as regular text or ordered lists.
