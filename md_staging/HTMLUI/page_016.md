# Essential HTMLUI for Windows Forms

## Source Code Location

The source code for HTMLUI Windows is available at the following default location:

```

```

## 2.3 Deployment Requirements

This section illustrates the deployment requirements for using Essential HTMLUI in the following topics:

### 2.3.1 Toolbox Entries

Essential HTMLUI places the following control into your Visual Studio .NET toolbox, from where you can drag each control onto a form and start working with it.

- HTMLUIControl

### 2.3.2 DLLs

While deploying an application that references a Syncfusion Essential HTMLUI assembly, the following dependencies must be included in the distribution.

#### Windows Forms â€“ HTMLUI

- Syncfusion.Core.dll
- Syncfusion.Shared.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.Shared.Windows.dll
- Syncfusion.HTMLUI.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.HTMLUI.Windows.dll
- Syncfusion.Scripting.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.MIME.Base.dll

**Note:** Syncfusion.HTMLUI.Base.dll depends on Syncfusion.MIME.Base.dll. So this needs to be included in the deployment of any application which uses HTMLUI.
