# 1 Overview

This section covers information on the HTMLUI control, its key features, prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers and finally the documentation details complimentary with the product. It comprises the following sub sections:

## 1.1 Introduction To Essential HTMLUI

Essential HTMLUI is a .NET Windows Forms control that supports Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) rendering. HTML elements are exposed as programmatic elements that support standard events. These elements can be custom-painted. HTMLUI can be used as a HTML viewer or to easily lay out and customize rich application interfaces.

This control will benefit those users who want to build flexible applications. Some good examples are applications that need to be localized, themed; interfaces that need to be updated through the network without distributing the whole application, and so on.

HTMLUI is helpful in creating cool UI applications like Chat windows. It can be used to create a multiple dialog application and it can be used as an UI Editor.

```csharp
this.liteHtml.Cursor = System.Windows.Forms.Cursors.WaitCursor;
this.liteHtml.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(8, 8);
this.liteHtml.Name = "liteHtml";
this.liteHtml.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(640, 224);
this.liteHtml.StartupDocument = @"D:\work\syncfusion\suitevss\Products\Devel";
```

### Key Features

Some of the key features of Essential HTMLUI are listed below:

- Essential HTMLUI uses the unique Syncfusion Flex-Layout mechanism to lay out any kind of user interface in a flexible manner. Defining the HTML for the layout renders the display with the rules of HTML layout applied automatically. This flexible approach to layout brings several advantages to applications that need their interfaces to be flexible.
