## Essential HTMLUI for Windows Forms

### 4.1 Loading HTML

HTML documents available at various resources can be easily loaded into the HTMLUI control. Some of the resources from where the HTML documents can be loaded are as follows:

- HTML files available on the disk
- HTML files available in the embedded resource
- As links from one HTML document to the other
- HTML files available in the URI
- HTML which is in the form of a text

An HTML document can be loaded into the HTMLUI control in two ways.

#### 4.1.1 Loading As a Startup Document

There may be situations where the HTML document is to be loaded initially at startup. An HTML document is loaded at startup for the front page applications. It may be an introductory page or a page that contains information regarding forthcoming pages. An HTML document can be loaded at Startup by two ways:

- Using the Properties window
- Coding

Using the Properties window involves specifying the location of the Startup HTML file in the **StartupDocument** property available within the properties window for the HTMLUI control or by clicking the link **Load from file** shown at the bottom of the properties window.
