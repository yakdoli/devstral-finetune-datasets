### Overview of Syncfusion Essential Studio

#### Essential Studio

Essential Studio is a comprehensive package that includes ten component libraries, each with unique and useful features. Some key components are:

- **Essential Tools**: A collection of user interface controls, including XP style controls and docking windows.
- **Essential Grid**: A customizable industry-standard grid control with extensive Excel-like features.

Studio\<Version Number>\Windows\HTMLUI.Windows\Samples\2.0\Loading
HTML\HTMLUIStartupDocument
```

### 4.1.2 Loading At Run Time

HTML documents can be loaded during runtime in several ways:

- **Sample runtime scenario**: A file link where an HTML file may link to another file, and a new file is loaded in the control after the initially loaded one.

The various ways of loading the document during runtime from different resources include:

- **Loading the file from disk**
- **As links from one HTML document to the other**
- **Loading the file from URI**

## API Reference

The documentation does not specify specific APIs; however, the description implies usage of HTMLUI controls for loading and displaying documents.

## Code Examples
