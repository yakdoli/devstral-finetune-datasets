With HTMLUI, the application developer can decide the appearance of his application even at runtime by setting the style according to his needs. A common application is changing the background color for a particular page based on the user signing in. These interactive applications help in developing user-friendly applications.

The HTMLUI control allows the following modes of changing the background color to your application:

- Inside the HTML document as Attribute
- Using the Style Sheets
