The image depicts a grid-like table layout filled with repeated "This is a test Test" entries, indicating a test document has been loaded successfully. A status message at the bottom confirms that the load succeeded.

### Key Points

1. **File Loading**: Any HTML document can be loaded from a file using the method shown in this sample. This method involves utilizing the appropriate properties or methods of the HTMLUI Control to parse and display the content of an HTML file.

2. **Dynamic Rendering**: The HTMLUI Control dynamically renders the content of the loaded HTML file, showcasing its capability to handle textual and structural elements typical in HTML documents.

## API Reference

### Methods Used

- **Load From File**: The method responsible for loading the HTML document from a file into the HTMLUI Control.
  - This method ensures that the HTML content is parsed and displayed accurately within the UI.
  - Parameters include the file path of the HTML document.

## Code Examples

### Example: Loading an HTML Document

Here is a sample code snippet demonstrating how to load an HTML document into the HTMLUI Control:

```csharp
// Loading HTML document from a file
string filePath = "path/to/your/file.html";
htmlUIControl.LoadFromUrl(filePath);

// Alternatively, loading from a URL
string url = "http://example.com/path/to/document.html";
htmlUIControl.LoadFromUrl(url);
```

### Notes
- Replace `"path/to/your/file.html"` with the actual path of your HTML file.
- Ensure appropriate error handling is implemented to manage scenarios where the file may not exist or fail to load.
