### Essential HTMLUI for Windows Forms

#### TextSelection

**Figure 54: HTMLUITextSelection Sample**

Essential HTML UI is a .NET Windows Forms control that supports HTML rendering. HTML elements are exposed as programmatic elements that support standard events, which can be custom painted and also support scripting. HTML UI can be used as a HTML viewer or to easily layout and customize rich application interfaces.

#### Essential HTML UI as a Layout Engine

Essential HTML UI uses Syncfusion's unique Flex-Layout mechanism to lay out any kind of user interface in a flexible manner. Define the HTML for the layout and HTML UI renders the display with the rules of HTML layout applied automatically. This flexible approach to layout brings several advantages to applications that need their interfaces to be flexible. Some good examples are applications that need to be localized, themed applications, interfaces that need to be updated through the network without distributing the whole application, etc.
