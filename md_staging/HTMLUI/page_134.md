```

## 4.16 Element Format

Essential HTMLUI supports formatting of not only the entire HTML document as a whole, but also the individual elements. With HTMLUI, the user can replace any HTML element into some other format before displaying, in a view to develop advanced user interactivity.

The following snippet shows how a text content can be replaced with an image in a text sequence.

```csharp
[C#]
private const string DEF_IMG_TAG = "<img src='..\\..\\clock.jpg'>";
private const string DEF_TIME = "time";
```
