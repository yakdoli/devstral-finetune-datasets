### 4.21.1 HTMLUIAutoScroll Sample

This sample illustrates the Scrolling feature supported in HTMLUI.

#### Figure: HTMLUIScrolling Sample
The figure (Figure 52) shows a screenshot of the Scrolling sample, which includes a window labeled "Scrolling." The window has sections detailing the features of various tools such as Essential Tools, Essential Chart, Essential Diagram, and Essential Edit. On the right side, there are options for scrolling to specific elements and controlling scroll behavior.

By default, this sample can be found under the following location:

```
C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\Version Number\Windows\HTMLUI.Windows\Samples\2.0\HTMLUIUserInteraction\HTMLUIScrolling
```

### 4.22 Scripting

Essential HTMLUI has extensive support for Scripts. Scripting involves creating self-contained documents. The concept behind this is to make the interface easier just by loading different HTML documents that contain the logic in themselves.
