## Essential HTMLUI for Windows Forms

### Displaying HTML Forms in HTMLUI

#### Overview
- HTMLUI provides robust support for displaying HTML forms in Windows Forms applications.
- Forms elements such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons are supported.
- Users can interact with these elements natively within the HTMLUI control.

#### Description
HTMLUI allows the integration of HTML forms into Windows Forms, enabling a rich interactivity experience. Figure 31 illustrates a sample of how HTML forms are displayed through HTMLUI. The window shows various form elements that can be customized and interacted with directly.

### 4.9 HTML Bookmarks

#### Overview
- HTML bookmarks are a feature in HTMLUI that allows users to switch to specific references in a page.
- This functionality supports both local and external link references for bookmarks.

#### Description
Bookmarks can be utilized to navigate to specific sections within the same page or across different pages. The HTMLUI control facilitates this by enabling the use of anchor tags `#bookmark` for internal linking and external linking to bookmarks in other files.

#### Sample Code

The following HTML code demonstrates how to implement bookmarks:

```html
[HTML]
<html>
<body>
    <a href="Newfile.htm#bookmark"> New file Book mark </a>
    <a href="#bookmark"> Bookmark in same file </a>
    <div id="bookmark"> Syncfusion's HTMLUI Control </div>
</body>
</html>
```
