# Essential HTMLUI for Windows Forms

## Overview
- HTMLUI is primarily used as an HTML renderer / viewer. The completely managed browser interface provided by HTMLUI is a natural choice for any HTML rendering interfaces such as custom web browsers, HTML help viewers, email readers, and so on.
- MHTML enables you to send and receive Web pages and other HTML documents using e-mail programs. MHTML enables you to embed images directly into the body of your e-mail messages rather than attaching them to the message. MHTML uses MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) which provides facilities to allow multiple objects in a single Internet e-mail message; represents formatted multfont text messages; represents non-textual material such as images, and so on.
