# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The appearance, alignment, position, and space settings of the `Child controls` can be changed using the extended `Constraints` on `gridBagLayout` property of the Child controls.

The Child controls can be rearranged by this Layout Manager also, but it can be done only at design time as in the `GridLayout` Manager.

## General Features

- Ability to create elegant user interfaces as quickly as possible.
- Reduces the time spent on creating, customizing, and supporting the layout of applications that contain a lot of controls.
- Maintains an effective and consistent layout.
- Provides an automatic control alignment feature which ensures that controls don't overlap one another even when the font settings are changed or the form is resized.
- Provides advanced capabilities for creating, customizing, and supporting the layout of controls within the Container control.

## Key Features

### Consistent Layout Management

Layout Manager automatically maintains a consistent layout of controls within a form. On resizing the form or changing the font settings of the controls, the layout will never break and the controls will never overlap.

### On-the-Fly Layout Customization

Layout managers create attractive layouts within a few seconds. Controls can be added to the layout in a really intuitive manner by dragging and dropping them onto the layout.

### Automatic Alignment

Layout Managers automatically align the controls horizontally / vertically, next to each other, with multiple controls within a single row, and multiple controls along the edge of another control.

### Size Constraints

It allows you to specify a control's width / height that can be varied only within a particular range, allow free sizing for the control vertically and / or horizontally or lock it to the current size. By default, specific size constraints are applied to all the Child controls within the Parent control.
