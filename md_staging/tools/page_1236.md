## 3.7.4.9 Toolbar State Persistence

### Overview

Toolbar state can be saved in two ways. A brief summary:

- **Automatic serialization of Tool bar position.**
- **It can be read/written to different media such as the default Isolated Storage, XML file, XML stream, Binary file, Binary stream and the Windows Registry.**

### Content

#### Toolbar Persistence Methods

- **Automatic serialization** ensures that the toolbar's positions are retained during run-time **if it is a MainFrameBarManager**. Conversely, **if it is a ChildFrameBarManager**, the toolbar's positions will be docked to the top border of the main frame.

- **Manual persistence** allows reading or writing to various storage mediums, enabling flexibility in saving toolbar positions across application sessions.

#### Specific Behavior and Settings

- **MainFrameBarManager**: If this is a MainFrameBarManager, the toolbar's positions will be retained during run-time as long as the **persisting toolbar position is turned on**. 

- **ChildFrameBarManager**: Only for the first run of the application, the toolbar will retain its position if the **AutoLoadToolbarPositions** and **EnableCustomizing** properties are configured accordingly. Subsequent runs will utilize the user's latest settings.

### Note

**This is true, only when your application is run for the first time and subsequent invocations will use the user's latest settings, if the persisting toolbar position is turned on.**

#### Storage Location

The position of the toolbar and the customization applied by the user are stored in the **user system's Isolated Storage**.

### Enabling/Disabling Persistence

Turn on or off the default persistence through the `BarManager`'s properties:
- **AutoLoadToolbarPositions**
- **EnableCustomizing**

#### Setting Example

```vb
Me.BarManager.BasicProperties.AutoLoadToolbarPositions = True
Me.BarManager.BasicProperties.EnableCustomizing = True
```

### Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

- **Overview**
  - List the summary of toolbar state management.
- **Content**
  - Describe methods for toolbar persistence and conditions for different managers (MainFrameBarManager, ChildFrameBarManager).
- **Specific Behavior and Settings**
  - Discuss the behavior of different settings and their impact on toolbar persistence.
- **Note**
  - Clarify the conditions under which the default settings persist for the first run vs. future invocations.
- **Storage Location**
  - Mention where the user's settings are stored.
- **Enabling/Disabling Persistence**
  - Show how to enable or disable persistence using relevant properties.
