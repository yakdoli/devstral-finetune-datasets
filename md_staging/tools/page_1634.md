## Content

### C# Implementation

```csharp
{
    this.statusBarAdvPanell.StartAnimation();
}

// Stop the animation.
private void button1_Click_1(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.statusBarAdvPanell.StopAnimation();
}

private void statusBarAdvPanell_AnimationDelayChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, 
    // when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" AnimationDelayChanged event is raised ");
}
```

### VB.NET Implementation

```vb
' Specify the delay of animation for the marquee style.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDelay = 50
' Set the IsMarquee property to 'True' to activate the animation.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.IsMarquee = True
' Handle the AnimationDelayChanged event.
AddHandler Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDelayChanged, AddressOf _
    statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDelayChanged

' Start the animation.
Private Sub Form1_Load_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.StartAnimation()
End Sub

' Stop the animation.
Private Sub button1_Click_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.StopAnimation()
End Sub

Private Sub statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDelayChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, 
    ' when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" AnimationDelayChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```
