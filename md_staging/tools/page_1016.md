## Overview

- Essential tools for Windows Forms include the Layout Manager, which can be added to forms by dragging and dropping appropriate layout managers from the toolbox.

## Layout Manager in Windows Forms

### Adding Layout Manager

- The Layout Manager can be added to the form by dragging and dropping the appropriate Layout Manager (for example, BorderLayout) from the toolbox onto your form. This will be automatically added to the component tray.

### Setting Container Control

#### Overview

- Optionally, you can drop Child controls onto the Container control to layout and set the `ContainerControl` property in the Layout Manager at design time.

#### Steps

1. **Optional Dropping Child Controls**: Drop the Child controls onto the Container control that you want to layout. The `ContainerControl` property in the Layout Manager will be automatically set.

2. **Setting the Container Control**: Form, Panel, or any control that inherits the Container control can be set as a Container control for the Child controls that are added. Here, the form is set as the `ContainerControl`.

#### Note

- **Automatic Layout Managment**: FlowLayout, CardLayout, and GridLayout controls automatically arrange the Child controls of the Container control in a specific manner. When new controls are added, the Layout Manager will ensure that the old layout is not broken and that the existing controls are not messed up.

### Configuring Child Controls

#### Overview

For BorderLayout and GridBagLayout, it is necessary to configure the Child controls by changing their extended properties via the property grid in the designer to ensure proper alignment.

#### Steps

- **Property Grid Configuration**: Use the property grid in the designer to modify the extended properties of the Child controls to achieve the desired alignment.
