*Figure 653: Layout Managers in Toolbox*

- **Container Control**  
  - Container control is a control on which the Layout Manager is dropped or for which the layout is designed.
  - All controls that inherit the `System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl` can act as a Container control.
  - Windows Form and Panel controls are the most widely used Container controls.

- **Child Control**  
  - Child controls can be added to the Container control by just dragging and dropping the controls from the toolbox.
  - The Layout Managers can be associated with any Container control property.
  - The Layout Managers automatically layout their Child controls based on specific constraints.
  - They can also be used to layout non-control-based components derived from a specific interface (`LayoutItemBase`) drawn within the Container.

#### Note

> Note: The Container control will be referred by its property name as `ContainerControl` and its children referred to as `Child components` (emphasizing the fact that the children need not be a control-derived class) in this document.
