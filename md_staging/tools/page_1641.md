# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This event is triggered when the `BorderColor` property changes, allowing for customization of a 2D border color.
- The event handler accepts an argument of type `EventArgs`.
- Examples in both C# and VB.NET are provided to demonstrate handling the `BorderColorChanged` event.

## Content

### BorderColor Property
The `BorderColor` property determines the color of the 2D border in a control. When this property is changed, the `BorderColorChanged` event is triggered.

#### C# Code Example
```csharp
// Set the border color for the StatusBarAdvPanel control using the BorderColor property.
this.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderColor = System.Drawing.Color.DeepPink;
// Set the BorderStyle property to 'FixedSingle' to view the 2D border color.
this.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle;

// Handle the BorderColorChanged event.
this.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderColorChanged += new EventHandler(statusBarAdvPanell1_BorderColorChanged);

private void statusBarAdvPanell1_BorderColorChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at runtime, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine("BorderColorChanged event is raised ");
}
```

#### VB.NET Code Example
```vb
' Set the border color for the StatusBarAdvPanel control using the BorderColor property.
Me.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderColor = System.Drawing.Color.DeepPink
' Set the BorderStyle property to 'FixedSingle' to view the 2D border color.
Me.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle

' Handle the BorderColorChanged event.
AddHandler Me.statusBarAdvPanell1.BorderColorChanged, AddressOf statusBarAdvPanell1_BorderColorChanged

Private Sub statusBarAdvPanell1_BorderColorChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at runtime, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine("BorderColorChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### Summary
- The `BorderColorChanged` event is used to detect changes in the border color of controls.
- The event can be handled using a custom method that processes the change.
- Both C# and VB.NET implementations are provided to ensure compatibility across different programming environments.
