## 3.9.2.5.3 How to set the GroupView control with no items selected when the Button View is set to True

When `ButtonView` is set to 'True', the user cannot set the selected index to -1 to make it as not selected. As an alternative, set the `ButtonView` to 'False' as a default and in the `GroupView`'s `MouseDown` event or `GroupViewItemSelected` event, set the `ButtonView` to 'True'.

The following code snippet illustrates this.

### [C#]

```csharp
// Set ButtonView in the MouseDown event.
private void groupView1_MouseDown(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e)
{
    this.groupView1.ButtonView = true;
}
```

### [VB.NET]

```vb
' Set ButtonView in the MouseDown event.
Private Sub groupView1_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs)
    Me.groupView1.ButtonView = True
End Sub
```
