# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

We can specify scrolling for the GroupBar control to view the set of GroupView Items back and forth. This can be achieved by setting the `IntegratedScrolling` property to 'True'.

| GroupView Property       | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Integrated Scrolling     | Setting this property will delegate the GroupView's scrolling to the Parent GroupBar control. This mode is exclusive to the VS .NET toolbox type interface where the GroupBar provides the scrolling support for its GroupView Child controls.<br><br>On disabling this property, scrollbars are set inside the GroupView control to scroll through the GroupView Items. |

### Code Examples

```csharp
this.gridView2.IntegratedScrolling = False;
```

```vb
Me(groupView1.IntegratedScrolling = False
```
