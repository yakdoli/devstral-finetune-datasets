TabControlAdv now supports animation on tab pages. Animated images in GIF format can be inserted in a tab page. The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel with a palette of up to 256 distinct colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. Both 3D and 2D formats are supported.

Users can insert graphics or logos with solid areas of color, small animations, low-resolution film clips, etc., to make the tab page more interactive and lively. The size of the image can also be adjusted.

There are two major properties which come into picture:
- Image
- Image size
