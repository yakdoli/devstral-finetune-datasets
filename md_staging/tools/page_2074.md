This section presents the various window styles available in Windows Forms, demonstrating their layout and arrangement options:

1. **Tile Horizontal Window Style**
   - Forms are arranged in a tiled horizontal layout.
   - Each form occupies a separate horizontal section of the window.
   - The forms are stacked side by side, allowing for easy scrolling.

2. **Tile Vertical Window Style**
   - Forms are arranged in a tiled vertical layout.
   - Each form occupies a separate vertical section of the window.
   - The forms are stacked one above the other, allowing for easy scrolling.

3. **Cascade Window Style**
   - Forms are arranged in a cascaded layout.
   - Each form overlaps slightly with the next, creating a layered effect.
   - This style is useful when working with multiple overlapping windows.

4. **Arrange Icons Window Style**
   - The forms are minimized to their icon representation and arranged in a grid layout.
   - Each icon represents a different form, allowing for easy visibility and management of multiple forms.
