### BorderSidesChanged Event

#### Overview
- The `BorderSidesChanged` event is fired when the `BorderSides` property value is modified. The `BorderSides` property specifies the border configuration of a panel.

#### Content
- **Event Trigger**: Occurs when the value of the `BorderSides` property changes.
- **Event Handler Argument**: Receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

#### Code Examples

##### C#
```csharp
// Draw border sides for the StatusBarAdv control using the BorderSides property.
this.statusBarAdv1.BorderSides = System.Windows.Forms.Border3DSide.Top;

// Handle the BorderSidesChanged event.
this.statusBarAdv1.BorderSidesChanged += new EventHandler(statusBarAdv1_BorderSidesChanged);

private void statusBarAdv1_BorderSidesChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // The below line will be displayed in the output window at runtime.
    Console.WriteLine("BorderSidesChanged event is raised ");
}
```

##### VB.NET
Code for handling the `BorderSidesChanged` event in VB.NET is not explicitly provided in the image. However, it can be inferred from the C# example that it would follow a similar structure.

### Summary of the Event Handling Process
- Set the `BorderSides` property of the panel to define the sides that should have borders.
- Attach an event handler to the `BorderSidesChanged` event to handle changes dynamically.
- Use the event handler to execute logic or display relevant information when the `BorderSides` property changes.
