### FolderBrowser control can be created in the following ways.

#### 3.5.7.1.2.1 Through Designer

The designer-based approach for creating and initializing the FolderBrowser component is shown below.

#### 1. Select the FolderBrowser control from the Visual Studio .NET toolbox window and drop it onto the design form. An instance of the FolderBrowser component will be added to the design form's component tray.

#### 2. Select a suitable value for the `FolderBrowser.StartLocation` property from the enumerator list provided by the property grid. This specifies the location at which browsing should be started in the folder hierarchy. This property is the functional equivalent of the `Win32 PIDL`s.

#### 3. Specify an appropriate value for the `FolderBrowser.Style` property. The `FolderBrowserStyles` enumeration specifies various options for the FolderBrowser Dialog.

#### 4. To display the FolderBrowser window, simply invoke the `FolderBrowser.ShowDialog()` method from within your application's code.
