### 3.18.2.9 UserControls as Tabs

**Normally TabbedMDI is used in MDI applications where the Child forms are the children that get tabbed. But, we can also use TabbedMDI with User Controls as children that are dockable.**

Add a UserControl to the form and initialize it inside the parent form. Add a DockingManager and a TabbedMDIManager Control. Dock the User Control and set it as an MDIChild using the below code snippet.

```csharp
UserControl Uc = new UserControl();
Uc.Parent = this;
// Dock the user control to the form.
this.dockingManager1.DockControl(Uc, this, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.DockingStyle.Tabbed, 200);
```
