# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The amount that should be added to the component's declared preferred size, when determining the preferred size for that component during layout can be specified using the properties given below.

| Child Control Constraints | Description                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IpadX                     | Specifies the pixels to be added to the size of the component when determining its overall width. The default value is set to 'Null'. |
| IpadY                     | Specifies the pixels to be added to the size of the component when determining its overall height. The default value is set to 'Null'. |

For example, if IpadX property is set to '10', then the preferred width of the Child control will be increased by 10 from that of the declared preferred size.

### Insets Rectangle

The padding that is to be added around the Child component can be specified using the property given below. Similar to the Ipad settings above, this space will be added to the Child control's preferred size when calculating the layout. However, unlike the Ipad settings, this will not increase the size of the Child control, but indicates the minimum padding to be applied around the Child control.

| Child Control Constraint | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insets                   | Specifies the extra space that the manager adds around a component's preferred bounds before laying out the component. The default value is set to 'Null'. |

The buttons below are all of equal non-zero weights and set to Fill.Both. However, they have an Insets property of (5,5,5,5), giving it a padding of 5 pixels on all sides.
