# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The SplashPanel class is a panel class that can be used beyond the typical splash screen. It can be used to create non-obtrusive message boxes such as in the Microsoft MSN messenger (as of MSN Messenger version 3.0), a message window that informs a user that a new mail message has arrived. These kinds of message boxes are very easy to create and use with the SplashPanel class.
