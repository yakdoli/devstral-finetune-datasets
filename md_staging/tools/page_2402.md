# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- **Note:** This section provides instructions on building dependencies for Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools assembly references, emphasizing the use of pre-built dlls and the removal of all versions before building.

## Content

### Important Notes:
1. **Source for Syncfusion.Core:** The source for Syncfusion.Core is not available as it is a licensing dll built with a separate private key. This pre-built dll can be shipped to any machine without modification, so building this dll can be ignored.
   **Note:** This dll can be used to build other dlls.
   
2. **Building Dlls:** All the dlls that should be used in the project should be built using the modifications mentioned above.
   
3. **Process Order:** The process should be started from Syncfusion.Shared.Base dll and continued in order.

### Building Approaches

Any of the following two approaches can be used to build the Tools.Windows related Syncfusion assembly references:

#### Approach 1: Manual Approach

Follow the procedure below to build the assemblies for Tools.Windows dll dependencies:

1. **Open Assembly Manager:**
   - Open Dashboard -> Assembly Management -> Run Assembly Manager.
   
   **Note:** The Syncfusion Assembly Manager (Version) window is displayed.

2. **Remove All Versions:**
   - Under the Actions group box, click Remove all versions.

3. **Perform Action:**
   - Click Perform Action.
   
   **Note:** All the Syncfusion assemblies saved on your system are cleared.

4. **Drag and Drop Syncfusion.Core dll to the GAC:**
   - Drag and drop the Syncfusion.Core dll to the GAC.
   
   **Note:** Syncfusion.Core dll can be used from the current shipping assembly saved under the path:
   
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Syncfusion\Essential Studio\7.3.0.20\precompiledassemblies\7.3.0.20\3.5
   ```

5. **Building Syncfusion.Shared.Base dll:**
   - Let us take building Syncfusion.Shared.Base dll as an example.
