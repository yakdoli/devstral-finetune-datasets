### 3.17.11.5 How to dynamically create a Form and add it to a Tab

Here is a code sample which demonstrates how you could dynamically create a Form and add that form to a new Tab.

#### C#
```csharp
// Form2 is the dynamically created form in your project that needs to be added to a Tab.
// Create the form and set its TopLevel property to false to enable setting its parent.
Form2 frm2 = new Form2();
frm2.TopLevel = false;
// Create the new tab which will display Form2TabPageAdv newtab = new TabPageExt("FORM_2");
this.tabControlAdv1.Controls.Add(newtab);
// Set the parent of Form2 to be the new tab and display the form in the newly created tab.
frm2.Parent = newtab;
frm2.Visible = true;
frm2.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
' Form2 is the dynamically created form in your project that needs to be added to a Tab.
' Create the form and set its TopLevel property to false to enable setting its parent.
Dim frm2 As Form2 = New Form2()
frm2.TopLevel = False
' Create the new tab which will display Form2.
```
