# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the use of the DrawWaitingCustomRender event for custom waiting render behavior.
- Explains how to replace the default waiting gradient with custom render segments.
- Details the event data and handling for custom rendering in Syncfusion ProgressBarAdv.

## DrawWaitingCustomRender Event

The `CustomWaitingRender` property indicates whether the waiting gradient will be replaced by another custom waiting render, which is defaulted to segments. When this property is set to `True`, it enables the custom waiting render behavior which will fire the `DrawWaitingCustomRender` event.

### Event Behavior
This event allows you to perform the desired custom drawing. If you perform custom drawing, you should specify that to the `ProgressBarAdv` (so that it does not perform its default painting), by setting `e.Handled = true`. If no custom painting is done, then you do not have to set the `Handled` value, and the `ProgressBarAdv` draws its default segmented waiting gradient. The type of segments is specified through the `ProgressFallbackStyle` with the options `Continuous`, `Tube`, `Gradient`, and `System`.

### Event Data

The event handler receives an argument of the type `ProgressBarAdvDrawEventArgs` containing data related to this event. The following `ProgressBarAdvDrawEventArgs` members provide information specific to this event:

| Members    | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Graphics   | Gets the graphic used to paint.                                            |
| Handled    | Gets / sets a value indicating whether the DrawWaitingCustomRender event was handled. |
| Rectangle  | Gets the bounding rectangle.                                               |

### Code Example

```csharp
private void progressBarAdv1_DrawWaitingCustomRender(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.ProgressBarAdvDrawEventArgs e)
{
    // Gets the graphics used to paint using the Graphics property
    e.Graphics.PixelOffsetMode.ToString();

    // If you perform custom drawing, you should specify that to the ProgressBarAdv
    // (so that it does not perform its default painting), by setting the below code.
    e.Handled = true;
}
```
