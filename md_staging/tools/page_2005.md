# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The `TabControlAdv` component in Syncfusion Windows Forms provides various sizing options to manage the display of tabs. The sizing modes can be set using the `TabSizeMode` property. Here are some examples of how to configure different sizing modes:

```csharp
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabSizeMode.ShrinkToFit
Me.tabControlAdv1.SizeMode = 
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TabSizeMode.FillToRight
```

## TabControlAdv with Various Size Modes

The `TabControlAdv` can be configured to display tabs in different modes based on the available space. Below are the visual representations of various size modes:
