# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses various properties and behaviors of a component in Syncfusion WinForms. These properties control functionalities such as bar movement, text orientation, and visibility.
- Key features include allowing users to drag bars, handle multiline wrapping, and control the appearance and behavior of the bars within the form.

## Content

### General Overview
#### Customizing Bar Behavior
- **Items**: Allows users to add or remove buttons and invoke a Customize dialog.

#### Note
- This is effective only with `Is MainMenu` unchecked.

### Properties and Their Descriptions

| Property             | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DrawDragBorder       | Allows the user to drag the bar around, move within the dock border, dock to different borders or float. To move the bar within the form, set `DrawDragBorder` to true. If not set, the user cannot move the bar. |
| Multiline            | Wraps the bar into multiple rows when there is not enough space in a row while docked or when the user resizes the floating bars. |
| IsMainMenu           | When checked, treats the bar as the main menu, forcing it to occupy the whole row irrespective of multiline settings. <br> **Note:** If selected for more than one bar, only the first setting will be effective; the rest will be ignored. |
| RotateWhenVertical   | The text in the bars will always be drawn as horizontal, irrespective of the docked position. To change this behavior, set `RotateWhenVertical` to true. |
| TextBelowImage       | Specifies whether the text in the bar should be drawn below the images in the toolbar. |
| UseWholeRow          | Forces the bar to occupy the full row when docked to the form's border. |
| Visible              | Hides or shows a bar. |
