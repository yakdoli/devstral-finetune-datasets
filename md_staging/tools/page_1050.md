# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

When the alignment is set to 'Justify', any extra space will be equally distributed across the other Child controls that have been justified differently within that same row. However, when there is a lack of sufficient space, the justified Child controls are shrunk proportionally based on their minimum size and preferred size settings (specifically, the difference between the two sizes).

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The Alignment property should be set to 'True' for the above properties to take effect.
