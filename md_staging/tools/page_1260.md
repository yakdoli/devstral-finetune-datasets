# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```csharp
{
    ParentBarItem barItem = sender as ParentBarItem;
    Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text + " Selected.");
}
else
    Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item Selected.");
}
```

## Overview
- The code snippet demonstrates how to handle various events for a `ParentBarItem` in a Windows Forms application.
- Events such as `Popup`, `PopupClosed`, and `Selected` are managed to display messages indicating their states.

### Handling Events in VB.NET

#### Event: `Popup`
Handles the event that occurs before the popup is displayed.

```vb
'Popup - event handled before the popup is displayed
Private Sub parentBarItem1_Popup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    If TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem Then
        Dim barItem As ParentBarItem = CType(IIf(TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem, sender, Nothing), ParentBarItem)
        Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text & " Popup.")
    Else
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item Popup.")
    End If
End Sub
```

#### Event: `PopupClosed`
Handles the event that occurs after the popup is closed.

```vb
'Popup event handled after the popup is closed
Private Sub parentBarItem1_PopupClosed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    If TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem Then
        Dim barItem As ParentBarItem = CType(IIf(TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem, sender, Nothing), ParentBarItem)
        Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text & " PopupClosed.")
    Else
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item PopupClosed.")
    End If
End Sub
```

#### Event: `Selected`
Handles the event when a menu item is selected.

```vb
'Displays Message when a menu item is selected
Private Sub parentBarItem_Selected(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    If TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem Then
        Dim barItem As ParentBarItem = CType(If(TypeOf sender Is ParentBarItem, sender, Nothing), ParentBarItem)
        Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text & " Selected.")
    Else
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item Selected.")
    End If
End Sub
```

## RAG Annotations
- \( sender \) is cast to `ParentBarItem` to handle specific events related to the bar items.
- The `Console.WriteLine` method is used to display messages indicating the state of the bar items, such as "Selected," "Popup," and "PopupClosed."
