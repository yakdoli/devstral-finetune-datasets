#### Handling the SplashClosed Event

The `SplashClosed` event is raised when the `SplashClosedNotify()` method is called. This method is an implementation of the `ISplashWrapperFormListener` for receiving notification from the `SplashWrapperForm` when the splash window is closed.

##### VB.NET Example

```vb
' Handle the SplashClosed event.
AddHandler Me.splashControl1.SplashClosed, AddressOf Me.splashControl1_SplashClosed

Private Sub splashControl1_SplashClosed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles splashControl1.SplashClosed
    Dim eventlogmessage As String = String.Format("Event: {0} Object: {1}" & Constants.vbCrLf, "SplashClosed", sender.ToString())
    textBox1.Text = textBox1.Text & eventlogmessage
End Sub
```

##### C# Example

```csharp
this.splashPanel1.SplashClosedNotify();
```

##### VB.NET Example

```vb
Me.splashPanel1.SplashClosedNotify()
```
