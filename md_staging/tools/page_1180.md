### What are ControlBars?
ControlBars in Essential Tools XP Menus framework enables application developers to add dockable/floatable controls to their form's toolbar layout. A common example of a ControlBar is the task pane window found in the Microsoft Office 2003 product suite.

A ControlBar is a full-featured docking container that can host any control and be docked along the border of the host form or floated as a top-level window. ControlBars, however, differ from traditional docking windows by adopting the characteristic layout behavior of a toolbar rather than that of a classic dockable control.

### Example of a Dockable ControlBar

In the image, the ControlBar is displayed as a toolbar-like component that can be docked at the top of the form. The docked ControlBar shows various options like "Overview," "Project Management," "Sections," and more, with functionality such as a "New" menu offering document creation options.
