### 3.5.4.5.5.1 How to add a ColorPickerUIAdv Control to a Popup Menu?

This is discussed in the **How to add a ColorUI Control to a Popup Menu?** topic in ColorUIControl. Replace `ColorUIControl` with `ColorPickerUIAdv` control in that topic, and you will be able to add a `ColorPickerUIAdv` control to a popup menu.

### 3.5.5 ComboBox Controls
ComboBoxControls with multiple functionalities are listed below.

#### 3.5.5.1 ComboDropDown
**ComboDropDown** is a lightweight, combo box-like control that can host any control in the dropdown area. This control can be used to create a combo box that shows, for example, a `TreeView` or a `ListView` with multiple columns or any other control that helps in displaying the data appropriately. The control is used to host any control where `ComboBoxBase` hosts only `ListBox` derived controls. This flexible combo box control provides a standard combo box look-and-feel with the ability to host any control in the dropdown.

Once a control is associated with the **ComboDropDown** to be displayed in the drop-down area, the developer is responsible for handling the data interaction between the combo's edit portion and the control in the drop-down. For example, if the **ComboDropDown** is used with a `TreeView` control in a drop-down, the developer has to provide the code to transfer the selected item from the `TreeView` control to the combo box and also from the combo box to the `TreeView`. You should also determine when the dropdown should close. In this case, the dropdown could close when the user double-clicks on a node.
