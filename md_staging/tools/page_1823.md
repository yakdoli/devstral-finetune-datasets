## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Overview
- Demonstrates how to manage child forms in a Windows Forms application.
- Explains merging ribbon panel elements with child forms.
- Highlights the importance of setting the `IsMdiContainer` property.

### Content

#### Visual Basic Code Example
The following code snippet shows how to create and display a `ChildForm` in a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application:

```vb
Dim fm As ChildForm = New ChildForm()
fm.MdiParent = Me
fm.Show()
```

#### Note on Implementation
>Note: The form's `IsMdiContainer` property must be set as true. Also, the `MDI Parent` ribbon form should host a `RibbonControlAdv` to get the `ChildForm's` panels to be merged.
