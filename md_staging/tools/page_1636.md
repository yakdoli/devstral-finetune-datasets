## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### AnimationDirection Property

This section explains how to specify the animation direction for the marquee style in Windows Forms.

```vb
' Specify the direction of animation for the marquee style.
Me.statusBarAdvPanell.AnimationDirection = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.MarqueeDirection.Right

' Set the IsMarquee property to 'True' to activate the animation.
Me.statusBarAdvPanell.IsMarquee = True

' Handle the AnimationDirectionChanged event.
AddHandler Me.statusBarAdvPanell.AnimationDirectionChanged, AddressOf statusBarAdvPanell_AnimationDirectionChanged

' Start the animation.
Private Sub Form1_Load_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanell.StartAnimation()
End Sub

' Stop the animation.
Private Sub button1_Click_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanell.StopAnimation()
End Sub

Private Sub statusBarAdvPanell_AnimationDirectionChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" AnimationDirectionChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### AnimationSpeed Property

This section explains how to specify the speed of animation for the marquee style.

```csharp
// Specify the speed of animation for the marquee style.
this.statusBarAdvPanell.AnimationSpeed = 7;
```

### AnimationSpeedChanged Event

**3.11.5.4.4 AnimationSpeedChanged Event**

- **Event Description:** This event is fired when the value of the `AnimationSpeed` property is changed. The `AnimationSpeed` property indicates the animation speed of the marquee style.

- **Event Handler:** The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

#### Code Example:

```csharp
// Specify the speed of animation for the marquee style.
this.statusBarAdvPanell.AnimationSpeed = 7;
```

### Additional Notes

- **Event Handling:** Ensure that the appropriate event handlers are implemented to handle changes in animation direction and speed.
- **Animation Speed:** The `AnimationSpeed` property allows developers to control how quickly the animation occurs.
- **Event Args:** The event handler for `AnimationSpeedChanged` will receive an argument of type `EventArgs`.
