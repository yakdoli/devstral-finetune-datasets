## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Overview
- Introduces the advanced `TabControlAdv` provided by the package.
- Highlights the capabilities for creating custom tabs with various styles and shapes.
- Explains the structure and functionality of `TabControlAdv` and `TabPageAdv` controls.

### Content

The XP Tabs (`TabControlAdv`) feature provided as part of this package is an advanced TabControl with plenty of appearance styles and configuration capabilities. It makes the creation of custom tabs with custom shapes and styles a snap.

Resembling the class names in the framework, the `TabControlAdv` and `TabPageAdv` classes represent the TabControl and the TabPages of the XP Tabs Package. Users can parent one or more tabpages to a tabcontrol which lets them switch between these tabpages via a TabStrip (which is also referred to as a TabPanel). The TabPages in turn are panel-derived classes that let users host ChildControls within them.

The `TabControlAdv` and the `TabPageAdv` controls come with full design-time support.

### 3.17.1 Features Overview

The Tabs framework contains the `TabControlAdv` with a full set of features to support efficient tab usage to create rich user applications.
