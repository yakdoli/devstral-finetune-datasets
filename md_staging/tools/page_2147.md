### TreeViewAdv Control Features

The TreeViewAdv control can be populated with a large number of nodes on node expand/collapse. The performance while populating the TreeViewAdv with a large number of nodes can be improved by the `SuspendExpandRecalculate` property.

### CheckBox support

Interactive check boxes that could be checked or unchecked, which will indicate the check state of the child node's check boxes.

### Node Images

Tree nodes can hold left images, right images, and images for different states of the nodes like expand and collapse.

### Load on demand

Enhances the performance by reducing the loading time of the nodes by displaying the nodes only on demand by the user. This provides the user to delay the loading of nodes in Trees, until the user initiates the nodes to expand.

### Customizing nodes

Allows you to edit and customize the nodes at all levels.

- **LabelEdit**: Property that helps users to easily edit the node text at run time.
- **Nodes selection**: Allows to select a single node or select all the nodes or only the specified nodes.
- **OwnerDrawNodes**: Property that allows the user to paint the background of the node.
- **Text Color**: Option to customize node text color.
- **Font**: Option to change the node's font.
- **HelpText**: Can be enabled for each and every nodes. Each node can display its own information.

### Scroll support

Provides automatic scrolling support for the treeview controls as well as hidden nodes when the mouse is near the borders.

### Sorting

Different types of sorting can be performed for the tree nodes like ascending, descending.
