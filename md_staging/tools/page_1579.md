### Control Settings and Event Handlers

The `SplashPanel` control comes equipped with several events and methods to manage the splash screen display and interaction. Below is the code snippet for handling these settings and events:

```vb
Me.splashPanel1.Location = Me.currentPt1
Me.splashPanel1.Visible = True

' Returns the SplashCloseType value indicating the way in which the splash was closed.
args.SplashCloseType.ToString()
End Sub
```

#### `SplashClosed` Event

The `SplashClosed` event is raised when the `SplashFormClosedNotify()` method is called. This method is an implementation of the `ISplashWrapperFormListener` for receiving notification from the `SplashWrapperForm` when the splash window is closed.

- **C#**:
```csharp
this.splashPanel1.SplashFormClosedNotify();
```

- **VB.NET**:
```vb
Me.splashPanel1.SplashFormClosedNotify()
```

### SplashMouseEnter Event

#### Introduction to `SplashMouseEnter` Event

When an application with `SplashPanel` is loaded, the splash screen will be displayed based on the alignment that is set. At this time, when the mouse is moved over the `SplashPanel` that is visible in the application, the `SplashMouseEnter` event will be raised. This event will not be triggered after the splash screen is closed.

#### Event Handler Details

The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs` containing data related to this event. You can handle this event by including the below code.

**C#**:
```csharp
// Handle the SplashMouseEnter event.
this.splashPanel1.SplashMouseEnter += new
EventHandler(splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter);

private void splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter(object sender,
System.EventArgs e)
```

## API Reference

### Methods

- **`SplashFormClosedNotify()`**  
  Called to notify the application when the splash window is closed. Implementation adheres to the `ISplashWrapperFormListener`.

### Events

- **`SplashClosed`**  
  Raised when the splash window is closed.
- **`SplashMouseEnter`**  
  Raised when the mouse enters the `SplashPanel` while the splash screen is visible.

## Code Examples

### Handling the `SplashMouseEnter` Event in C#

```csharp
// Attach the event handler to the SplashMouseEnter event.
this.splashPanel1.SplashMouseEnter += new
EventHandler(splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter);

private void splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter(object sender,
System.EventArgs e)
{
    // Add custom logic here.
}
```

### Handling the `SplashMouseEnter` Event in VB.NET

```vb
' Attach the event handler to the SplashMouseEnter event.
Me.splashPanel1.SplashMouseEnter += New
System.EventHandler(AddressOf splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter)

Private Sub splashPanel1_SplashMouseEnter(ByVal sender As Object,
ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    ' Add custom logic here.
End Sub
```
