# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

- To let the framework automatically merge as new instances of the child types that are created.
- Explicitly merge child types as soon as the application is started.
- Explicit merging is recommended for better performance, usability and for VS.NET like behavior.
- Explicit merging is performed by calling the `RegisterMDIChildTypes` method with appropriate parameters (see the above section reference for example).

> **Note:** This step is relevant only if your form is an MDI container. `[IsMDIContainer = True]`
