# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Highlights the handling of events in the context of Popups in Windows Forms.
- Explains the use of the `Popup` and `BeforePopup` events to manage the behavior of Popups.
- Discusses handling data transfer from a Popup to the controls on the Form.
- Provides an example for setting focus to the `PopupControlContainer` to enable mnemonics.

## Content

### Popup Event
This event is triggered after the popup is displayed and made visible. Below is an example that demonstrates the use of the `Popup` event.

- **Mnemonic Support**:  
  The controls within the `PopupControlContainer` do not respond to mnemonics because the main form gains focus immediately after the `PopupControlContainer` is displayed. To enable mnemonic functionality, the focus can be set back to the `PopupControlContainer` in the `Popup` event handler.

#### Code Example

[C#]

```csharp
private void popupControlContainer1_Popup(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    this.popupControlContainer1.Focus();
}
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Private Sub popupControlContainer1_Popup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    Me.popupControlContainer1.Focus()
End Sub
```

### BeforePopup Event
This event occurs before the popup is displayed and can be utilized to prepare necessary actions or conditions before the Popup appears.

---

## API Reference

- **`PopupCloseType`**: A value indicating the way in which the popup can be closed.
- **Event Handling**: This event can be handled to transfer data from the Popup to the controls on the Form.
