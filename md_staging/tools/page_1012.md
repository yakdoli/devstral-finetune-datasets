# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

Layout Managers allow the user to customize the layout of the controls using code snippets.

## Content

### Design Time Arrangement using Verbs

We can arrange the layout of Child controls using the Bring to front and Send to back design time verbs.

#### Focus Management

An end-user can move the focus between the Child controls using the TAB key. This feature is enabled by default.

#### AutoLabel

AutoLabel is a label-derived control that lets you pair a label with any other control. Once paired, the AutoLabel will be automatically repositioned as the labeled control's position changes.

#### Layout Support for Third Party Controls

Layout Managers allow the user to layout the third party controls over the Parent controls without registering the respective controls.

#### Spacing and Margins

The Layout Managers provide horizontal and vertical spacing between the layout border and components and also provide the right margin and left margin between the Client rectangle and layout rectangle.

#### Layout support for Non-Control Based Components

Layout Managers allow the user to layout the non-control based components when they implement a simple interface.

#### Event Handling

Layout Managers support event handling.

Controls laid out by Flow layout, Grid Layout can now be rearranged simply by dragging the controls in the designer.
