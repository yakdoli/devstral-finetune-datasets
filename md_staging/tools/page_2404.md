### Setting Up the Build Manager

1. **Note**: All the Syncfusion assemblies saved on your system are cleared.
   - **Action**: Open Dashboard -> Run Build Manager.
     - Upon completion, the Syncfusion Build Manager (Version) window is displayed.

2. **Framework Version**:
   - Under the **Framework Version** group box, click the required .NET Framework.

3. **Product**:
   - Under the **Product** group box, select the required product from the drop-down list.

4. **Assembly Type**:
   - Under the **Assembly Type** group box, click the required assembly type.

5. **Perform Build**:
   - Click **Perform Build**.
     - **Note**: All the required Syncfusion assemblies are built in order.

### Using Built Assemblies

- The set of assemblies built can now be used in your project.

### Important Note on Private Key Settings

- **Note**: If the private key setting of any one of the assemblies is modified, the rest of the assemblies (to be used in the project) should be built with the same key.
