### Handling Mouse Events in TreeView

This section demonstrates a method to handle mouse events in a tree view control (`TreeViewAdv`).

#### Event: ScrollControlHandledMouseDown

This event is triggered when the scroll control of the tree view is scrolled, and the mouse button is pressed.

##### C# Example
```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // This code prints mouse button that is pressed.
    Console.Write("Button :" + e.Button.ToString());

    // This returns the no of times the mouse button was pressed.
    Console.Write("Clicks :" + e.Clicks.ToString());

    // This prints the Delta value.
    Console.Write("Delta value :" + e.Delta.ToString());

    // This returns the location of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Location :" + e.Location.ToString());

    // This returns the X coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("X coordinate :" + e.X.ToString());

    // This returns the Y coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Y coordinate :" + e.Y.ToString());
}
```

##### VB.NET Example
```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)

    ' This code prints mouse button that is pressed.
    Console.Write("Button :" + e.Button.ToString())

    ' This returns the no of times the mouse button was pressed.
    Console.Write("Clicks :" + e.Clicks.ToString())

    ' This prints the Delta value.
    Console.Write("delta Value :" + e.Delta.ToString())

    ' This returns the location of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Location :" + e.Location.ToString())

    ' This returns the X coordinates of the mouse while generating
```

### Notes
- The `MouseEventArgs` object provides various properties to capture details about the mouse event.
- The `Button` property indicates which mouse button was pressed.
- The `Clicks` property indicates the number of clicks.
- The `Delta` property is specific to mouse wheel events, indicating the wheel movement.
- The `Location`, `X`, and `Y` properties provide the coordinates of the mouse during the event.

## API Reference
### Properties
- `Button`: The `MouseButtons` value that represents the mouse button pressed.
- `Clicks`: The number of clicks that initiated the event.
- `Delta`: The vertical change in position of the wheel of the mouse. Typically, its value will be -120, 0, or 120.
- `Location`: The location of the mouse pointer as a `Point`.
- `X`: The x-coordinate of the mouse pointer.
- `Y`: The y-coordinate of the mouse pointer.

### Methods
- `ToString()`: Returns the human-readable version of the `MouseEventArgs` object.

## Code Examples
The above sections provide examples in both C# and VB.NET for handling mouse events in a tree view control. These examples demonstrate how to access and print various properties of the `MouseEventArgs` object.
