# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Content

### Design Time Verbs

The **Bring To Front** and **Send To Back** design time verbs are used to move controls to the front or back of the layout order.

#### FlowLayout Note

Note: The `FlowLayout` will treat each control and its autolabel pair as a single unit during layout.

#### C# Code Example

```csharp
// Declare the FlowLayout.
private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayout flowLayout1;

// Initialize the Flowlayout and set the panel control as it's Container control.
this.flowLayout1 = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayout(this.components);
this.flowLayout1.ContainerControl = this.panel1;
```

#### VB.NET Code Example

```vb.net
' Declare the FlowLayout.
Private flowLayout1 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayout

' Initialize the Flowlayout and set the panel control as it's Container control.
Me.flowLayout1 = New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayout(Me.components)
Me.flowLayout1.ContainerControl = Me.panel1
```

### Setting Constraints on Input Controls

Now set some appropriate constraints on the input controls as follows:

- **First Name textbox:**
  - Select the `First Name` textbox and browse to the extended **Constraints** on `flowLayout` property.
  - Set the **HAlign** property to 'Justify', so that this control's width will be resized to fit any available empty horizontal space in the row.
  - Specify an appropriate preferred size for the control, such as `(100, 20)`.

- **Middle Initial textbox:**
  - The `Middle Initial` textbox needs to be left-aligned and not justified.
  - This is the default constraint setting, so no changes are needed.

- **Last Name textbox:**
  - Select the `Last Name` textbox and specify the same constraints as the `First Name` textbox.

- **Address textbox:**
  - The `Address` textbox should always begin in a new row, so set the **NewLine** property to 'True' in its constraints.
  - Also, set the **HAlign** property to 'Justify' and provide a preferred size.

- **State combobox and Zip textbox:**
  - The `State` combobox and `Zip` textbox controls can also be left with the default constraints.
