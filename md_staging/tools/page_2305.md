### How to Select All the Nodes in a TreeViewAdv Control

You could select all the nodes in the TreeViewAdv control by recursively traversing through all the child nodes under each of the parent nodes at the top level as shown in the code below.

```csharp
[C#]

// Checking for all the root nodes in the tree.
foreach (TreeNodeAdv node in this.treeViewAdv1.Root.Nodes)
{
    this.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNodes.Add(node);
    TreeNodeAdv lastNode = node.LastNode;
    while (lastNode != null)
    {
        // The selection is extended to the last node of the tree.
        this.treeViewAdv1.ExtendSelectionTo(lastNode);
        lastNode = lastNode.LastNode;
    }
}
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

Dim node As TreeNodeAdv
' Checking for all the root nodes in the tree.
For Each node In Me.treeViewAdv1.Root.Nodes
    Me.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNodes.Add(node)
    Dim lastNode As TreeNodeAdv = node.LastNode
    While Not (lastNode Is Nothing)
        ' The selection is extended to the last node of the tree.
        Me.treeViewAdv1.ExtendSelectionTo(lastNode)
        lastNode = lastNode.LastNode
    End While
Next
```

## API Reference

- `SelectedNodes`: Represents the collection of selected nodes in the TreeViewAdv.
- `ExtendSelectionTo(TreeNodeAdv)`: Method to extend the selection to a specific node.

## Code Examples

- The C# example demonstrates how to recursively select all nodes starting from the root nodes down to the last child nodes.
- The VB.NET example achieves the same functionality, showing language-specific syntax but achieving the same outcome.
