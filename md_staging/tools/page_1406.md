## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```csharp
private void gvcWinForms_GroupViewItemRenamed(object obj, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.GroupItemRenamedEventArgs arg)
{
    ListViewItem listViewItem1 = new System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem(new string[] { "GroupViewItemRenamed", "Old Label: " + arg.OldLabel + " New Label: " + arg.NewLabel });
    this.listView1.Items.Add(listViewItem1);
}
```

### [VB.NET]
```vb
' This event occurs when a GroupView Item in the GroupView is renamed.
Private Sub gvcWinForms_GroupViewItemRenamed(ByVal obj As Object, ByVal arg As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.GroupItemRenamedEventArgs) Handles gvcWinForms.GroupViewItemRenamed
    Dim listViewItem1 As ListViewItem = New System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem(New String() {"GroupViewItemRenamed", "Old Label: " + arg.OldLabel & " New Label: " + arg.NewLabel})
    Me.listView1.Items.Add(listViewItem1)
End Sub
```

### 3.9.2.4.7.3 GroupViewItemSelected Event

It occurs when a GroupView Item in the GroupView control is selected.

Accessing the `GroupView.SelectedItem` property from within the `GroupViewItemSelected` event handler will allow you to determine the item that was clicked. Based on this appropriate command, handling routines can be invoked.

The `GroupView.SelectedItem` property is accessed from within the handler to determine the selected item.

#### [C#]
```csharp
// Provide a handler for the GroupView.GroupViewItemSelected event.
this.groupView1.GroupViewItemSelected += new System.EventHandler(this.groupView1_GroupViewItemSelected);
// GroupView.GroupViewItemSelected event handler.
// The GroupView.SelectedItem property fetches the index of the selected item, while the item is obtained by referencing the selected index within the GroupView.GroupViewItems collection.
```
