# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Child controls can be positioned along the borders and at the center using the BorderLayout Manager.
- In the CardLayout Manager, Child controls are treated as cards inside the ControlContainer, viewed one at a time.
- FlowLayout Manager allows arranging Child controls vertically or horizontally depending on the `LayoutMode` property.
- GridLayout Manager enables arranging Child controls in a grid with specified rows and columns.
- GridBagLayout functions like GridLayout but allows specifying row/column sizes and control spanning multiple cells.

## Content

### BorderLayout

- Child controls can be positioned along the borders and at the center using this Layout Manager.

### CardLayout

- Child controls are treated as cards inside the Container control, viewed one at a time.
- The CardLayout Manager allows displaying images as cards and provides options for the user to browse through the images.

### FlowLayout

- Child controls are added either vertically or horizontally depending on the mode specified by the `LayoutMode` property.
- The direction of display can be reversed to suit the needs of the user.
- The Alignment of Child controls can be set to Near, Far, Center, and ChildConstraints. When set to 'ChildConstraints', individual alignment can be changed using extended `Constraints on flowLayout` properties found in the Child controls' properties grid.
- Child controls can also be rearranged at design time and run time.

### GridLayout

- This Layout Manager allows arranging Child controls in a grid containing rows and columns, specified by the user.
- Child controls can be prevented from participating in the layout using the `ParticipateInLayout` property.
- Child controls can be rearranged only at design time, unlike FlowLayout, which allows rearranging at run time also.

### GridBagLayout

- This functions similar to GridLayout but allows specifying the size of rows or columns in the grid and Child controls can span more than one cell.
