# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```vb
' Displays the splash screen as a modal dialog.
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.splashControl1.ShowDialogSplash(New Point(700, 700), New Form1())
End Sub
```

The below example uses a button click event to call this method. This method is overloaded. The overloaded method passes the owner form as a parameter to this method.

## Time Interval Settings

The SplashControl is, by default, a timed display splash screen. The splash screen will be displayed for a specific time period and will then be closed. By default, the value will be set as 5000. User can change this value, run the application and see the difference.

| SplashControl Property | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| TimerInterval           | The time interval for which the splash screen is to be displayed (in milliseconds). |

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
this.splashControl1.TimerInterval = 3000;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.splashControl1.TimerInterval = 3000
```
