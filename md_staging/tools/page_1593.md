## AutoSize and AutoSizeMode Properties

### Purpose

The `AutoSize` and `AutoSizeMode` properties are essential for controlling how controls in a Windows Forms application adjust their size based on their contents.

#### AutoSize Property

- **Description**: Specifies whether a control will automatically resize itself to fit its contents.

#### AutoSizeMode Property

- **Description**: Specifies the mode by which the control automatically resizes itself. The options included are:

  - **GrowAndShrink**: The control grows and shrinks to fit its contents, potentially deviating slightly from the Size property.
  - **GrowOnly**: The control grows as necessary to fit its contents but does not shrink below the size specified in the Size property.

### Example Code

Here's how you can set these properties in both C# and VB.NET:

#### [C#]

```csharp
this.statusBarAdv1.AutoSize = true;
this.statusBarAdv1.AutoSizeMode = System.Windows.Forms.AutoSizeMode.GrowOnly;
this.statusBarAdv1.AutoHeightControls = true;
```

#### [VB.NET]

```vb
Me.statusBarAdv1.AutoSize = True
Me.statusBarAdv1.AutoSizeMode = System.Windows.Forms.AutoSizeMode.GrowOnly
Me.statusBarAdv1.AutoHeightControls = True
```

## AutoHeight Settings

### Purpose

The height of the panels in StatusBarAdv can be made to change automatically when the height of the StatusBarAdv control changes. This is controlled using the `AutoHeightControls` property.

#### AutoHeightControls Property

- **Description**: Determines if the StatusBarAdv will resize the height of the panels according to its own height.

### Summary

This section explains how to configure controls to resize dynamically using `AutoSize` and `AutoSizeMode`. Additionally, it describes how to ensure that the height of panels within StatusBarAdv adjusts automatically by setting the `AutoHeightControls` property. These features are crucial for maintaining a clean and responsive user interface in Windows Forms applications.
