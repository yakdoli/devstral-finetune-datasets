  - Tab style with a dark gray background and bright text for contrast.
  - Example includes distinct dark blue and white elements.

#### Header Images
The image also showcases various header images that can be used with the Ribbon2013 style. These images include:

- Spirograph design
- Cloud pattern
- Grid and circular shapes
- Leaf design

These header images are intended to provide different visual themes for the Ribbon interface.

### Tool Strip Tab Items
The tool strip tab items (e.g., **File**, **Home**, **New**, **Open**, **Save**, **Print**) are shown in each color scheme, demonstrating how they integrate visually with the chosen theme.

## API Reference
