## State Persistence in Task Bar Boxes

### Overview:
- Maintains the collapsed state of the child control's task bar boxes.
- Persists the cached state in Isolated Storage when the control is disposed.
- Reapplies saved states on the task bar boxes when the application loads again.
- Controls the persistent store and timing of persistence using specific methods.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Collaps ed state of the child boxes**:
  - The control manages the collapsed state of its child task bar boxes. 
  - This state is serialized and cached, ensuring consistent behavior across application sessions.

- **Persistence Mechanism**:
  - The_cached state is persisted in the Isolated Storage when the control is disposed. 
  - If the child task bar boxes are added to this control, the saved state is reapplied when the application reloads.

- **User-Specific Persistence**:
  - State is saved in the Isolated Storage of the system, scoped by the current user identity. 
  - This ensures that persistence is user-specific and not shared across different users using the same application.

- **Control over Persistence**:
  - You can manually control how and when the persistence occurs using the methods `LoadBoxExpandedStates()` and `SaveBoxExpandedStates()`.
  - These methods allow precise timing and scope of persistence, providing flexibility in managing the state of the task bar boxes.

### API Reference

#### Methods
- **LoadBoxExpandedStates()**
  - Loads and reapplies the saved expanded states of the task bar boxes.
  - Usage: This method is typically called during the application's initialization to restore the user's previous settings.

- **SaveBoxExpandedStates()**
  - Saves the current expanded states of the task bar boxes for future persistence.
  - Usage: This method is called before the application is closed or the control is disposed to ensure the states are stored.

### Code Examples (C#)

```csharp
// Example: Loading andPersisting Expanded States
public void HandleTaskBarBoxPersistence()
{
    // Load saved states when initializing
    taskBarControl.LoadBoxExpandedStates();

    // Save states when disposing the control
    taskBarControl.SaveBoxExpandedStates();
}
```
