### 3.5.4.2 Event Handling

This section covers the following event:

#### 3.5.4.2.1 ColorSelected Event

This event is triggered when a color from a Color Group is selected. The example below demonstrates how to close the ColorUI displayed in a Popup Menu using this event.

In the `ColorSelected` event, the following coding ensures that the popupControlContainer containing the ColorUI Control is closed once a color is selected.

```csharp
private void colorUIControl_ColorSelected(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // Ensures that the PopupControlContainer is closed after the selection of a color.
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.ColorUIControl cuicontrol = sender as Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.ColorUIControl;
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer pcc = cuicontrol.Parent as Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupControlContainer;
}
```
