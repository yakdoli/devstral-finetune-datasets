### 3.14.1.2 Creating Range Slider

Range Slider can be created in two ways:

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
- If the body contains a local Table of Contents for this page, keep it as a bullet/numbered list with links/text as shown. Do not create links that donâ€™t exist.
- Ignore global site TOC or breadcrumbs unless the page explicitly describes them.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- Extract ALL code exactly. Use fenced blocks with language: ```csharp, ```vb, ```xml, ```xaml, ```js, ```css, ```ts, ```python.
- Keep full signatures, imports/usings, comments, region markers.
- Inline code in text should be wrapped with backticks.

## API Reference (if applicable)
- Namespace, Class, Members (Methods/Properties/Events/Enums) in subsections.
- Parameters table: Name | Type | Description | Default | Required
- Returns: Type + description.
- Exceptions: bullet list.

## Cross References
- Add See also: bullet list of explicit links/texts present on the page. Do not fabricate.

## RAG Annotations
- At the end, add an HTML comment with tags and keywords derived ONLY from visible content:
  <!-- tags: [product, module, control, api, version?] keywords: [k1, k2, ...] -->
 - Add optional per-section anchors as HTML comments before each H2/H3 to aid chunking, using IDs derived from the heading (kebab-case), e.g., <!-- anchor: tools#page_1933#getting-started -->. Do not add if the heading text is unclear.
