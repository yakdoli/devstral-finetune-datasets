The ToolStrip family of controls provides common interfaces for producing user interface elements for Windows Forms. Essential Tools has come up with ToolStripEx which exhibits advanced features.

Using the smart tag of the Ribbon panel or using "Add ToolStrip" verb in the property grid, we can add ToolStripEx controls. ToolStrip items can be added to this ToolStripEx easily.
