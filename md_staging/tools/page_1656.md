## Clock Customization

**Figure 1076 Applied Color for Gradient Back Color, Hands Color, Minutes Color and Border Color**

### Appearance setting

Clock control allows you to customize the thickness of the hands and minute line. It also allows you to enable or disable the AM/PM, borders, minute and second hand. The Clock control gives a transparent appearance.

### Customization of hands thickness:

Clock control allows you to adjust the thickness of hands and minute line.

The following code illustrates how to adjust the thickness of the hands and minute line:

```csharp
[C#]
this.clock1.HourHandThickness = 7;
this.clock1.MinuteHandThickness = 5;
this.clock1.SecondHandThickness = 2;

this.clock1.MinuteThickness = 4;
```

```vb
[VB]
Me .clock1.HourHandThickness = 7
Me .clock1.MinuteHandThickness = 5
Me .clock1.SecondHandThickness = 2
```
