## 3.9.1 GroupBar

The GroupBar and GroupView controls abide by the container-client model and are designed to work in perfect synchronization with each other.

The GroupBar class implements a tab-type container control similar to the Windows Forms TabControl that can serve as a host for other Windows Forms controls. Each control in the GroupBar is represented by a **GroupBar Item** and navigation between the different controls is accomplished by selecting the corresponding GroupBar Item. Only the selected control is displayed at any particular time.

The GroupBar may be used in combination with the GroupView control to implement clones of some of the popular UI components such as the Microsoft OutlookBar and the Visual Studio .NET toolbox window.
