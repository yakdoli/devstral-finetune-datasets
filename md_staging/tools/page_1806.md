### Quick Access Toolbar

#### Overview
The quick access toolbar provides easy access to the controls that are used in the Office 2007 controls. The visibility of this toolbar can be controlled using the `RibbonControlAdv.QuickPanelVisible` property.

#### Setting Visibility
The visibility of the Quick Panel can be managed programmatically using the following code snippets:

```csharp
this.ribbonControlAdv1.QuickPanelVisible = true;
```

```vbnet
Me.ribbonControlAdv1.QuickPanelVisible = True
```

#### Adding Controls
Controls can be added to the Quick Access Toolbar by clicking on the **Edit quick items** link in the smart tag of the `RibbonControlAdv` control. This opens the **Customize Quick Access Toolbar** dialog, which allows you to add and organize the required toolbar items.

The dialog features an Office 2007 look and feel, as shown in Figure 1197.

### Accessing the Customize Quick Access Toolbar Dialog

To access the **Customize Quick Access Toolbar** dialog, follow these steps:

1. Open the smart tag of the `RibbonControlAdv` control.
2. Click the **Edit quick items** link to open the dialog.

The dialog will have a layout similar to the following:

- **RibbonControlAdv Tasks**
  - **Edit quick items...**
  - **Add main tab item**
  - **Layout**
    - ShowQuickPanelBelowRibbon
