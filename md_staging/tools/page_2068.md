The `DetachFromMdiContainer` method is used to detach an MDIParent from the TabbedMDIManager.

#### 3.18.2.2 Through Code

This section will explain how to create a TabbedMDIManager programmatically. It explains how to hookup the TabbedMDIManager to the MDIParent Form.

Here the main Form is assumed to be the MDIParent Form. Hence, any Form added to the main Form, i.e., the MDIParent Form, will be treated as TabbedMDIChild Forms and will be displayed using the TabbedMDI look and feel, similar to Visual Studio .NET.

To create a TabbedMDIManager programmatically:

1. Create or open a Windows Forms project.
2. Add Syncfusion's Tools.Windows and Shared.Base assemblies to the application.
3. Add the Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools namespace.

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;
```

```vb.net
Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools
```

4. Declare the TabbedMDIManager in Form1.

```csharp
private TabbedMDIManager tb;
```

```vb.net
Private WithEvents tb As tabbedMDIManager
```

5. Initialize the TabbedMDIManager.
