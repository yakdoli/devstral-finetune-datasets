### 3.11.3.5 Frequently Asked Questions

This section illustrates the solutions for various task-based queries about the control.

#### 3.11.3.5.1 The property CloseOnClick is used but SplashPanel is not closing when clicking on child control. How to close the splash panel

When the CloseOnClick property is set to `true`, the Splash Panel closes when clicked. However, this is not applicable for the child controls inside the Splash Panel. To enable this feature, you need to call the `HideSplash` method inside the click event of the particular control.

For example, if you want to close the SplashPanel when clicking its child control, say `Label1`, handle its click event as follows.

**C#**

```csharp
private void label1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.splashPanel1.HideSplash();
}
```

**VB.NET**

```vb
Private Sub label1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.splashPanel1.HideSplash()
End Sub
```
