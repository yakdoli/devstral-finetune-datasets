### On Focus / Off Focus

| TreeViewAdv Properties           | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ShouldSelectNodeOnEnter            | Indicates whether a default node should be selected when the treeviewadv control gains focus. By default, this property is true.                              |
| HideSelection                      | Indicates if the treeviewadv hides its selected nodes when not focussed. This should be set to false to highlight the selected nodes.                           |

### 3.21.3.2.3.1 Mouse and Keyboard Based Selection

Setting the `AllowKeyboardSearch` property of the treeview to true will allow the user to search for a node by typing the name of the node using the keyboard. User needs to ensure that the TreeViewAdv control is focussed while searching.

By setting the `AllowMouseBasedSelection` property to true, multiple nodes can be selected with a mouse down, and these selected nodes can be dragged.

| TreeViewAdv Properties            | Description                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AllowKeyboardSearch                | Gets or sets a value indicating if keyboard based searching should be allowed.                                                  |
