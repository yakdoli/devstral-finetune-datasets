### Content
#### Docking Manager Features
- **Dock State Persistence**:
  The docking manager stores dock state information in default storage mediums, such as XML files and databases. For more details, refer to Dock State Persistence.

#### Nested Docking
- **Support for Nested Docking**:
  The docking windows framework fully supports nested docking layouts.

#### Design-Time Drag-and-Drop and Floating
- **Drag-and-Drop Capabilities**:
  The docking manager architecture allows user controls to be dragged, dropped, and floated during design time, similar to runtime behavior.

#### Docking - MDIChild Transitions
- **Syncfusion Dockable Controls**:
  These controls can seamlessly transform to and from MDIChild forms using pre-wired context menus or programmatic APIs. Combined with the Essential Tools TabbedMDI framework, docking and MDIChild window states can be switched like in the Visual Studio .NET IDE.

#### DockToFill Option
- **DockToFill Feature**:
  This feature enables users to create layouts where the entire client region of a non-MDIContainer form is composed of dockable controls.
- **DockToFill Mode**:
  The DockToFill mode capability of the docking manager creates forms composed entirely of dockable windows.

#### Caption Buttons
- **Customizable Caption Buttons**:
  The docking manager allows users to set the visibility of the close button, Maximize button, Minimize button, and Menu button on the title bar of the docked control. See Caption Buttons.

#### Custom Caption Button
- **Customization of Caption Buttons**:
  Custom Caption Buttons is a new feature in Docking Manager, allowing users to customize existing caption buttons (e.g., menu button, close button, autohide button, maximize button) and create new caption buttons.

#### Container Control Support
- **Docking within Container Controls**:
  The Syncfusion docking windows architecture fully supports docking windows within container controls. Dockable controls hosted within child controls are automatically bound to the visibility state of the parent control hierarchy, and floating windows are synchronized with the host container's visibility.
