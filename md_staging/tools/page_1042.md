## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### FlowLayout in Windows Forms

#### Overview
- **Automatically Aligns Controls**: A FlowLayout rearranges controls based on the current font size, form size, and localization settings.
- **Horizontally Aligned Labels**: Automatically adjusts control sizes and locations, aiding in the creation of efficient form layouts.
- **Preferred Component Size**: Uses the preferred size of a Child component for layout logic.

### Features and Functionality

#### Flexible Layout Adjustments
- In its most flexible and powerful mode, a FlowLayout automatically realigns the controls by adjusting their sizes and locations based on:
  - Current font size
  - Form size
  - Localization settings
- Helps in creating efficient form layouts.

#### Layout Logic
- The FlowLayout uses the preferred size of a Child component.
- The minimum size is generally ignored, except in the constraint-based scenario.

#### Scenarios
##### Simple Scenario
- No constraints associated with the Child components.
- Layout Manager does not expect any constraints.

##### Constraint-Based Scenario
- Constraints are specified for each Child component.

### Sample and Installation

#### Accessing the Sample
- A sample demonstrating the FlowLayout is available at the following installation path:
  ```
  ..My Documents\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\Version Number\Windows\Tools.Windows\Samples\2.0\Layout Manager Package\LayoutManagers
