# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates the use of the `skinManager1` to apply themes to controls in a Windows Forms application.
- Focuses on setting the parent control for skin management to either a specific control (e.g., `calculatorControl1`) or the entire form (e.g., `Form1`).
- Highlights the property grid setup for configuring the `skinManager1` and applying the `Office2007Black` theme.

### Interfacing with Skin Management
The figures below illustrate the process of applying a custom theme to a Windows Forms application using the Syncfusion `skinManager1` control.

#### Figure 1327: Calculator control is set as parent control.

The first figure (Figure 1327) shows a Windows Forms application with a calculator interface. The `skinManager1` is configured to apply the `Office2007Black` theme to the `calculatorControl1`. The Properties panel shows the settings for `skinManager1` with the following key details:
- **Controls**: `calculatorControl1`
- **VisualTheme**: `Office2007Black`

This setup ensures that the skin theme is applied specifically to the embedded `calculatorControl1` rather than the entire form.

#### Figure 1328: Form1 is set as parent control.

The second figure (Figure 1328) illustrates an alternative setup where the `skinManager1` is applied to the entire `Form1`. The Properties panel reflects this change in the following configuration:
- **Controls**: `Form1`
- **VisualTheme**: `Office2007Black`

This configuration ensures that all controls within `Form1` inherit the `Office2007Black` theme, providing a unified appearance across the entire form.

### Steps to Configure Skin Management

1. **Add a `skinManager1` control**: From the Toolbox, drag and drop the `skinManager1` control onto the form.
2. **Set the `Controls` property**:
   - For a specific control, select the `calculatorControl1` checkbox in the `Controls` dropdown.
   - For the entire form, select `Form1` in the `Controls` dropdown.
3. **Choose a theme**:
   - Select the desired theme from the `VisualTheme` dropdown (e.g., `Office2007Black`).
4. **Generate and apply the theme**:
   - Rebuild and run the application to see the theme take effect.

#### Key Properties
- **Controls**: Specifies which control(s) are managed by the skin manager.
- **VisualTheme**: Defines the theme to be applied to the selected controls.

### Example Property Grid Settings for `skinManager1`
The following screenshot, referenced in both figures, provides a clear view of the property grid configuration:
- **ApplicationSettings**
  - **(Name)**: `skinManager1`
  - **Controls**: Choose between `calculatorControl1` or `Form1`
  - **GenerateMember**: `True`
  - **Modifiers**: `Private`
  - **VisualTheme**: `Office2007Black`
