### 3.6.4.4.4 Enabling Constrained FlowLayout on a Container

This section will illustrate how Constrained FlowLayout can be used to implement complex form layout logic.

For example, create a 'User Info entry' panel with autolabels, textboxes, and comboboxes to allow the user to enter personal information. This Container panel should also be capable of handling different widths by repositioning and resizing the Child controls appropriately.

#### Steps to achieve the above layout and behavior are described below.

1. Place five textboxes and one combobox to represent the different data input controls in the panel.

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]

// Declare the textboxes, combobox and panel controls.
private System.Windows.Forms.TextBox textBox5;
private System.Windows.Forms.TextBox textBox4;
private System.Windows.Forms.TextBox textBox3;
private System.Windows.Forms.TextBox textBox2;
```

## API Reference

None provided in this section.

## Code Examples
