# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Specifies alignment of FlowLayout based on 'ChildConstraints'.
- Utilizes constraint-based layout logic for components.
- Constraints can be set for each child control during design time.

## Content

### Figure 676: Alignment = "Near"

Once you specify the alignment of a FlowLayout as 'ChildConstraints', the Layout Manager will use a constraint-based layout logic based on the constraints specified on each Child component. During design time, the constraints can be specified for each Child control through the following extended property.

| FlowLayout Property                     | Description                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constraints on flowLayout              | Specifies the alignment of layout components in the direction of flow when the Alignment property is set to 'ChildConstraints'. |

#### C#
```csharp
this.flowLayoutPanel1.Alignment =
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowAlignment.ChildConstraints;
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
Me.flowLayoutPanel1.Alignment =
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowAlignment.ChildConstraints
```

#### Note
Refer `FlowLayout - Configuring Child Controls` topic to know about HAlign, VAlign and other options provided by the Constraints on flowLayout property.
