## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### 3.8.1 Features Overview

The MultiColumnTreeView control has the following features:

#### Features

- **Styles Architecture** - Supports a flexible style architecture to let users define the styles for nodes at different levels of the Tree. It helps users specify the styles for a specific node or for a class of nodes.
  
- **Columns** - Lets you add multiple columns and subitems.
  
- **Checkbox and Option Buttons support** - Interactive check boxes that can be checked or unchecked, which will indicate the check state of the child node's check boxes. Nodes can also hold option buttons.
  
- **Node Images** - Tree nodes can hold left images, right images, and images for the different states of the nodes like expand and collapse.
  
- **Load on demand** - Enhances performance by reducing the loading time of the nodes by displaying them only on demand by the user. This provides the user to delay the loading of nodes in Trees, until the user initiates the nodes to expand.
  
- **Customizing nodes** - Allows you to edit and customize the nodes at all levels.
  - **LabelEdit** - Property that helps users to easily edit the node text at run time.
  - **Nodes selection** - Allows to select a single node or select all the nodes or only the specified nodes.
  - **OwnerDrawNodes** - Property that allows user to paint the background of the node.
  - **Text Color** - Option to customize node text color.
  - **Font** - Option to change the node's font.
  - **Helptext** - Can be enabled for each and every node in the first column. Each node can display its own information.
  
- **Scroll support** - Provides automatic scrolling support for the treeview controls as well as hidden nodes when the mouse is near the borders.
  
- **Sorting** - Different types of sorting can be performed for the tree nodes like ascending, descending.
  
- **Office2007ScrollBars** - TreeViewAdv provides support for Office2007 Scrollbars with all the three color schemes.
