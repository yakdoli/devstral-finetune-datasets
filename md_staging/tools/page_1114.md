### Filling Toolbars with BarItems

#### Figure 727: Filling Toolbars with BarItems

You can drag and dock the toolbars on all four sides of the designer by dragging through the gripper on the left of the toolbar and moving them to any desired position. The toolbars can also be floated. See **Toolbar Properties** for more details.

**Note:** If a toolbar from the mainFrameBarManager and one (or more) from the child forms gets merged (the rules for merging are discussed in the **MDI Merging** topic), the BarItems in the toolbar will be ordered based on their **MergeOrder** property.

#### ChildFrameBarManager Behavior

If this is a **ChildFrameBarManager**, all the toolbars (including the main menu) will be floating at design-time. This is because the child toolbars will be docked to the main form rather than to your child form during run-time, and hence, floating avoids polluting your child forms during design-time.
