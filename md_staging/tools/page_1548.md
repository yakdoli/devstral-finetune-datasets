# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

Note: The time interval for which the SplashPanel is displayed can be customized using the **Time Interval** settings provided in the SplashPanel control.

The above methods are explained below in detail.

## ShowSplash()

This method is used to display the SplashPanel at runtime.

The parameters discussed for the ShowSplash() method are as follows:

| **Parameters**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Location             | Indicates the point in screen coordinates. The value can be 'Point.Empty'.     |
| OwnerForm            | Indicates the form that will embed the splash form.                            |
| DisableOwner         | Indicates whether the owner form is to be disabled.                            |

When the SplashPanel is getting displayed, the owner form will be disabled when the DisableOwner parameter is passed as 'True'. You can assign any form as the owner form.

The below code snippet will display the SplashPanel at the specified location with the owner form being disabled. The location will be effective only when the **DesktopAlignment** property is set as 'Custom'.

**[C#]**

```csharp
Form2 f2 = new Form2();

// To display the SplashPanel call the ShowSplash() method.
this.splashPanel1.ShowSplash(new Point(100, 100), f2, true);
```

**[VB.NET]**

```vbnet
Private f2 As Form2 = New Form2

' To display the SplashPanel call the ShowSplash() method.
Me.splashPanel1.ShowSplash(New Point(100, 100), f2, True)
```

- **HideSplash()** - The SplashPanel can be hidden by calling this method at runtime.
