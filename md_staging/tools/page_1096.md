### Layout Managers in Windows Forms
The figure below depicts a scenario where multiple layout managers are employed to manage the arrangement of controls within a Windows Forms application.

#### Figure: GridLayout with Panel1 as Container Control

* **Panel3:** Serves as a container for its child controls.
* **Panel2:** Another container control.
* **Panel1:** Contains buttons (`button1` and `button2`), demonstrating the use of GridLayout.

### Using GridBagLayout Manager
- We can also make Panel2 as the Container control for **GridBagLayout** Manager.
- This will arrange its Child controls (Buttons) in a single row as shown below.

### Expected Arrangement
- Panel2 would typically contain buttons arranged in a row using the GridBagLayout Manager.

### Implementation
1. **Panel2 as Container Control:** Configure Panel2 to use the GridBagLayout Manager.
2. **Child Controls:** Add buttons to Panel2, specifying the GridBagLayout constraints for a single-row arrangement.

## Conclusion
This page illustrates the use of different layout managers in Windows Forms, specifically showcasing the GridBagLayout Manager and its ability to arrange child controls in a single row using Panel2 as the container.

## Code Examples
To implement the scenario, you can use code like the following:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public class MainForm : Form
{
    public MainForm()
    {
        Panel panel2 = new Panel();
        panel2.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
        panel2.AutoSize = true;

        GridBagLayout gridBagLayout = new GridBagLayout();
        panel2.Controls.SetStyle(ControlStyles.ContainerControl, true);
        panel2.Layout += (s, e) => gridBagLayout.LayoutContainer((Panel)s);

        Button button1 = new Button { Text = "button1" };
        Button button2 = new Button { Text = "button2" };

        panel2.Controls.Add(button1);
        panel2.Controls.Add(button2);

        button1.GridBagY = button2.GridBagY = 0;
        button1.GridBagWidth = button2.GridBagWidth = 1;

        Controls.Add(panel2);
    }
}

static class Program
{
    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new MainForm());
    }
}
```

## API Reference
- **GridBagLayout:** A layout manager that allows precise control over the placement of child controls using constraints.
- **Controls.SetStyle:** Configures the style of the control. Here, it is used to set the control as a container.
