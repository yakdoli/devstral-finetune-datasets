# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Adding Event

```vb
' Adding event.
Public Event FontSelected As System.EventHandler
```

### Handling Event in Code

2. Override the `OnSelectedIndexChanged` method and fire the event there.

#### C# Implementation

```csharp
protected override void OnSelectedIndexChanged(EventArgs e)
{
    // FontSelected event fires here.
    if(FontSelected!=null) FontSelected(this,e);
    base.OnSelectedIndexChanged (e);
}
```

#### VB.NET Implementation

```vb
Protected Overrides Sub OnSelectedIndexChanged(ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' FontSelected event fires here.
    RaiseEvent FontSelected(Me, e)
    MyBase.OnSelectedIndexChanged(e)
End Sub
```

### Label Controls

#### 3.5.10 Label Controls

The following are the advanced versions of Windows Label controls.

##### 3.5.10.1 AutoLabel

The AutoLabel control is a label-derived control that lets you pair a label with any other control. Once paired, the AutoLabel will be automatically repositioned as the labeled control's position changes.

### Figure 595: AutoLabel Control

The FlowLayoutPanel layout manager will always treat the AutoLabel-labeled control pair as a unit. You can use AutoLabels and FlowLayouts together to implement complex and powerful form layouts.
