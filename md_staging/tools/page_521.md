### 3.5.4.4 ColorPickerButton

#### Overview
The Essential Tools **ColorPickerButton** allows .NET developers to provide a standard user interface similar to the Visual Studio .NET color picker dropdown, for selecting colors in Windows Forms applications. The **ColorPickerButton** displays the **ColorUIControl** as a drop-down in combination with a button. The .NET framework provides a color dialog control to allow applications to collect color information from users. However, the color dialog control does not provide any way to place a control within the layout of the application to collect color information. The Essential Tools **ColorUIControl** provides an easy-to-use color palette control that can be placed inline in your applications.
