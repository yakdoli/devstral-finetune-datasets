### Customization Methods for `TabbedMDIManager`

#### Unlocking and Locking MDIClient Update Events

In Windows Forms applications, it is necessary to manage MDI clients based on interactions such as locking or unlocking updates. The following code snippets demonstrate how this can be achieved.

**C#**
```csharp
private void unlockToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.tabbedMDIManager1.UnLockMDIClientUpdate();
}

private void lockToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.tabbedMDIManager1.LockMDIClientUpdate();
}
```

**VB.NET**
```vb
Private Sub unlockToolStripMenuItem_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.tabbedMDIManager1.UnLockMDIClientUpdate()
End Sub

Private Sub lockToolStripMenuItem_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.tabbedMDIManager1.LockMDIClientUpdate()
End Sub
```

#### Customizing the Distance between Tabs and Controls in `TabbedMDIManager`

To adjust the spacing between tabs and controls within `TabbedMDIManager`, the `BottomBorderHeight` property of the `TabHost` can be modified. This is typically done by overriding the `TabbedMDIManager` class.

**Explanation**
- **Property to Modify**: `BottomBorderHeight`
- **Access Point**: Through `TabHost`
- **Method**: Override the `TabbedMDIManager` in your application logic.

By setting the `BottomBorderHeight` property, you can control the vertical spacing, enhancing the layout and user experience in MDI applications.
