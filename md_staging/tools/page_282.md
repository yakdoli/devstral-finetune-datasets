Essential Tools for Windows Forms

Figure 115: AutoComplete Control Implemented on a ComboBox

## Overview

- For example, when a user starts to enter an URL in the Address edit control that is embedded in the Microsoft Internet Explorer navigation toolbar, autocompletion expands the string into one or more complete URLs that are consistent with the existing partial string. A partial URL string such as "sync" might be expanded to "http://www.syncfusion.com" or "http://www.syncfusion.com/faq/winforms". This feature will be useful in windows applications that require collecting frequently repeated input from the user.
- The .NET framework does not provide any built-in support for providing autocompletion in the System.Windows.Forms.Textbox or System.Windows.Forms.Combobox classes. The Essential Tools AutoComplete class provides an easy way of adding autocompletion to edit controls in an application. Autocompletion is typically used with edit controls (text box controls) or with controls that have an embedded edit control (such as combo box controls).
- The AutoComplete class is implemented as an Extender Provider similar to the ToolTip control in the Windows Forms package.
