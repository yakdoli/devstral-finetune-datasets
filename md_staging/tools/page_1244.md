# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

XP Menus supports Visual Inheritance during design-time, which means you can set up XP Menus in a form and also continue to set up in the form derived from it. The corresponding components like the BarManager and toolbar should however be protected or public for this to be supported. In the derived form's designer, you can add new bar items to the bar manager and then add these items to the toolbar, submenu, etc.

These are things you can do in a derived form in Visual Inheritance mode.

- Add new BarItems created in the derived form to any toolbar, ParentBarItem, anywhere.
- Reposition the existing BarItems within a toolbar or ParentBarItem.
- Remove an existing group setting and add a new group setting.

These are the **limitations** of Visual Inheritance mode.

- Cannot add menu items created in a base form to any bars/submenus in a derived form.
- When the items in a base form's toolbar/submenu are repositioned, any previous repositioning that occurred in the derived form will be lost and the results may be unpredictable.

## 3.7.4.11 UI Command Update Patterns

The UI Command Update mechanism can be defined as the way in which, an application updates the state of the UI elements (BarItems in this case), as the state of the application changes.

Different frameworks support different ways of UI state update mechanism. Each has its own merits and demerits and each one is appropriate in some scenarios and not so in the other.

The XP Menus framework supports multiple patterns of UI Command Update mechanism, which are discussed below.

- **Supply-Push Approach**

  In this approach, the state of the BarItem is changed as and when the corresponding application state changes. This is what the XP Menus framework expects you to do by default; it will not commence the `UpdateUI` event under any circumstances.

- **Demand-Pull Approach**

  This approach can be difficult, as it is sometimes cumbersome to keep track of state changes in the application and update the UI state appropriately.

So, the framework provides two other alternative ways to update the BarItem states.
