# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- ToolTip - Allows us to show and hide tooltips for the nodes in the first column wherever necessary.
- Drag and Drop - Provides support for advanced drag and drop of the nodes.
- Context Menus - TreeViewAdv has the ability to associate context menus with the option to show and hide wherever necessary. This pops up when the right mouse button is clicked on a tree node.
- Custom Control - Support for custom control feature allows to add custom controls to the tree node of the first column alone.
- Multiline Support for Nodes - TreeNodeAdv has now provided the option to enable multiline text for each node by using the `Multiline` property, which is available for individual nodes. This can be set through NodeCollection Editor and it has to be set for individual nodes.
- Appearance - The control provides the background and foreground properties for customizing the appearance of the control.
- Enhanced performance - TreeViewAdv control can be populated with a large number of nodes on node expand / collapse. The performance while populating the TreeViewAdv with a large number of nodes can be improved by the `SuspendExpandRecalculate` property.
