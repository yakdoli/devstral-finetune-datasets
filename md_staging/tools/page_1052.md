# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

In code, you can specify constraints through the `SetConstraints()` method. The `FlowLayoutConstraints` type defines the constraint that can be specified on a Child component.

## Setting the Constraints Programmatically

In the coding given below, the constraints are set to the particular control along with the constraint values like Active, HAlign, VAlign, NewLine, ProportionalColWidth and ProportionalRowHeight.

```csharp
this.flowLayout1.SetConstraints(this.textBox1, new
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayoutConstraints(true,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.HorzFlowAlign.Justify,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.VertFlowAlign.Center, false, false,
false));
```

```vb.net
Me.flowLayout1.SetConstraints(Me.textBox1, New
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.FlowLayoutConstraints(True,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.HorzFlowAlign.Justify,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.VertFlowAlign.Center, False, False,
False))
```

- 3.6.4.43 Centering the Child Controls Horizontally and Vertically

This topic illustrates how to center the Child controls both vertically and horizontally using the Child constraints.

**Note:** Constraints need to be used because the Child controls will otherwise be centered either vertically or horizontally based on whether the layout mode is 'Vertical' or 'Horizontal'.

When the layout mode is 'Horizontal', set the `HAlign` property to 'Center' and `ProportionalRowHeight` property to 'True' in the constraints for all the Child controls. This will center the Child controls vertically and horizontally as shown.
