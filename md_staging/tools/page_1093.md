It is very simple to use more than one Layout Manager in a single form.

- Drag-and-drop the FlowLayout Manager from the toolbox onto the form, setting it as the Container control.

## API Reference

This section references the Layout Manager classes and their configuration options:
- **FlowLayout Manager**: This control allows arranging child controls in a horizontal flow pattern. It can be used as a container for other controls.

## Code Examples

The following code snippet demonstrates how to programmatically add a FlowLayout Manager to a form:

```csharp
using System.Windows.Forms;

// Drag-and-drop the FlowLayout Manager from the toolbox onto the form
var flowLayout = new FlowLayoutPanel();
flowLayout.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
this.Controls.Add(flowLayout);

// Add buttons to the FlowLayout Manager
for (int i = 1; i <= 8; i++)
{
    var button = new Button { Text = $"Button{i}" };
    flowLayout.Controls.Add(button);
}
```
