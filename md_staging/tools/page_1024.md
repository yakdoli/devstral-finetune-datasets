# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Specifies the importance of setting custom layout bounds when the container is resizable and highlights the need to adjust margin settings for layout management.
- Explains how margin settings influence the layout bounds by adjusting the space between the client rectangle and the layout rectangle.
- Details the properties that control margin settings and provides code examples for setting these properties in both C# and VB.NET.

## Content

### Note: Layout in Resizable Containers
: When you specify the custom layout bounds and the Container is resizable, you should also set the AutoLayout property to 'False' and set a new custom layout bounds when the Container resizes.

### Note: Layout within the Container's Client Rectangle
: The layout is done within the Container's client rectangle, even if the Container has a scrollable display rectangle.

#### 3.6.4.1.2 Margin Settings

The margin settings that are common to all the Layout Managers are discussed below.

The layout bounds will also be adjusted to include some margin space along the borders according to the values specified in the properties given below. The default values of these properties are set to 'Zero'.

| **LayoutManager Properties** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| TopMargin | Gets / sets the top margin between the client rectangle and the layout rectangle. |
| HorzNearMargin | Gets / sets the left margin between the client rectangle and the layout rectangle. |
| HorzFarMargin | Gets / sets the right margin between the client rectangle and the layout rectangle. |
| BottomMargin | Gets / sets the bottom margin between the client rectangle and the layout rectangle. |

### Code Examples

#### C#
```csharp
this.borderLayout1.TopMargin = 20;
this.borderLayout1.HorzFarMargin = 20;
this.borderLayout1.HorzNearMargin = 20;
this.borderLayout1.BottomMargin = 20;
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
Me.borderLayout1.TopMargin = 20
Me.borderLayout1.HorzFarMargin = 20
Me.borderLayout1.HorzNearMargin = 20
Me.borderLayout1.BottomMargin = 20
```
