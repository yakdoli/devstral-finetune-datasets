# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```vb
' To Load
Dim serializer As New AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.XMLFile, _
    "myfile")
Me.tabbedMdiManager.LoadTabGroupStates(serializer)
```

## Singleton method

The AppStateSerializer is set to use the IsolatedStorage format by default. When the user does not need the states to store in the Isolated Storage area, it could be changed by initializing the AppStateSerializer's Singleton at the beginning of an application.

### C#

```csharp
// Initializing the AppStateSerializer's Singleton at the beginning of an application.
AppStateSerializer.InitializeSingleton(SerializeMode.XMLFile, "myfile");
```

### VB.NET

```vb
' Initializing the AppStateSerializer's Singleton at the beginning of an application.
AppStateSerializer.InitializeSingleton(SerializeMode.XMLFile, "myfile")
```

Below are the code snippets for different storage mediums.

### To serialize in Binary Format, use the below code.

#### C#

```csharp
// To Save
AppStateSerializer serializer = new AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.BinaryFile, "myfile");
this.tabbedMdiManager.SaveTabGroupStates(serializer);
serializer.PersistNow();

// To Load
AppStateSerializer serializer = new AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.BinaryFile, "myfile");
this.tabbedMdiManager.LoadTabGroupStates(serializer);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' To Load
Dim serializer As New AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.XMLFile, "myfile")
UC2MDiManager.LoadTabGroupStates(serializer)
```

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- Extract ALL code exactly. Use fenced blocks with language: ```csharp, ```vb, ```xml, ```xaml, ```js, ```css, ```ts, ```python.
- Keep full signatures, imports/usings, comments, region markers.
- Inline code in text should be wrapped with backticks.
