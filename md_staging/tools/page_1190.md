![ControlBar Sample](https://example.com/controlbar_sample_image.png)

This image shows the context menu with various options, including "Add Task Box," which is selected to include the TaskBox in the control bar.

### Resultant Form

The resultant form after adding the TaskBox is as follows:

- The TaskBox is integrated into the ControlBar, enhancing the user interface.
- Additional details about the resultant form layout and functionality are not specified in the image.

### WinForms-specific Implementation

The process of adding a TaskBox to the ControlBar typically involves:

1. Accessing the context menu associated with the ControlBar.
2. Selecting the "Add Task Box" option from the list.
3. Customizing the TaskBox properties and functionality as needed.

#### Example Code for Adding TaskBox (C#):
```csharp
// Assuming controlBar is an instance of the ControlBar
ToolButton taskBoxButton = new ToolButton();
taskBoxButton.DisplayStyle = ToolStripItemDisplayStyle.Text;
taskBoxButton.Text = "Task Box";
controlBar.Items.Add(taskBoxButton);
```
