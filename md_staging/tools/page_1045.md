# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The document focuses on key properties of the `FlowLayout` control in Windows Forms.
- It explains the `HGap`, `VGap`, and `AutoHeight` properties, their descriptions, and provides sample code in both C# and VB.NET.
- A visual example illustrates the effect of setting `HGap` and `VGap` properties.

## Content

### FlowLayout Property Details

| FlowLayout Property | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| HGap                | Gets / sets the horizontal spacing between the components. |
| VGap                | Gets / sets the vertical spacing between the components.   |

#### Setting HGap and VGap in Code

**[C#]**
```csharp
this.flowLayoutPanel1.HGap = 20;
this.flowLayoutPanel1.VGap = 20;
```

**[VB.NET]**
```vb
Me.flowLayoutPanel1.HGap = 20
Me.flowLayoutPanel1.VGap = 20
```

#### Visual Example

> *Note:* The visual example shows buttons arranged vertically with spacing set by `HGap` and `VGap` properties.

### AutoHeight

The height of the Container control can be automatically increased when there is a lack of sufficient space to show the Child components in the horizontal alignment mode. This is useful to enforce minimum heights on Container controls and forms.

#### AutoHeight Property Details

| FlowLayout Property | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| AutoHeight          | Specifies if the Container's height should be enforced to the minimum when in horizontal alignment mode. |
