#### 3.18.2 Creating TabbedMDIManager
This tutorial will show you how the TabbedMDIManager is created through designer and code, which are discussed in the below topics.

##### 3.18.2.1 Through Designer
To create a TabbedMDIManager through designer,

1. Drag-and-drop a TabbedMDIManager Control from the ToolBox onto the Form1.
2. As soon as the control is dropped, the Form1's `IsMDIContainer` property will be set to `True` and it changes to an MDIContainer. Also, the `AttachedTo` property of the TabbedMDIManager will be set to Form1. Add a new Form (Form2) to your application.
