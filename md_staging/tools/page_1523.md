#### 3.11.2.3.3.1 Integrating SplashPanel to SplashControl

A SplashControl allows the user to add an image that is to be displayed in the splash screen. However, the SplashControl also allows the user to add a SplashPanel control which can be customized by the user.

#### Steps to Integrate SplashPanel into SplashControl

1. Add the required `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools` and `Syncfusion.Shared.Base` assemblies.
2. Drag and drop a SplashControl form the toolbox onto the form. The SplashControl will be created in the components area of the form.
3. Drag and drop a SplashPanel control from the toolbox.
4. Design the SplashPanel with the required controls (You can add any user interface control to the SplashPanel).
5. Populate the SplashPanel with the SplashControl using the `CustomSplashPanel` property.
6. The SplashControl uses the SplashPanel only if the `UseCustomSplashPanel` property is set to 'True'.

#### Example: Customizing the SplashPanel

Create a SplashControl and add the below code to the form to customize the SplashPanel and display the SplashPanel as the splash image.

```csharp
// Add the required namespace.
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;

// Declaration of controls.
private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashControl splashControl1;
private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashPanel splashPanel1;
private System.Windows.Forms.Label label1;

// Initialization of controls.
this.splashControl1 = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashControl();
this.splashPanel1 = new
```

## API Reference

- `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashControl`
- `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashPanel`
- `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Label`
- `SplashControl.CustomSplashPanel`
- `SplashControl.UseCustomSplashPanel`

## Code Examples

```csharp
// Sample code to initialize and use SplashControl with CustomSplashPanel
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;

private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashControl splashControl1;
private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashPanel splashPanel1;
private System.Windows.Forms.Label label1;

// Initialize controls
this.splashControl1 = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashControl();
this.splashPanel1 = new
```

### Notes
- Ensure all required assemblies are referenced in your project.
- Customize the SplashPanel as needed before assigning it to the SplashControl.
