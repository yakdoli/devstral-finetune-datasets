## Overview

This section explains how to overlay images on the images associated with tree nodes in a `TreeViewAdv` control using the `OwnerDrawNodes` property and the `AfterNodePaint` event.

## Image Overlaying

The steps below will show how you could draw overlay images on the images associated with the tree nodes.

1. **Set the TreeViewAdv's `OwnerDrawNodes` property to true.**
2. **Handle the TreeViewAdv's `AfterNodePaint` event as shown in the code below to perform overlaying of images.** The below code snippet shows overlaying `LeftImagesX`. The same code snippet can be used for overlaying `RightImagesX` and `StateImagesX` also by replacing `LeftImagesX` with `RightImagesX` and `StateImagesX` respectively.

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_AfterNodePaint(object sender,
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs e)
{
    // Suppose you wish to draw an overlay image on the image associated with the selected node.
    TreeNodeAdv node = this.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode;
    // Get the position of the node's image.
    Point point = new Point(node.LeftImagesX,
        node.TextAndImageBounds.Y);
    // Perform image drawing.
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(overlayImage, point);
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_AfterNodePaint(sender As Object, e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs) Handles treeViewAdv1.AfterNodePaint
    ' Suppose you wish to draw an overlay image on the image associated with the selected node.
    Dim node As TreeNodeAdv = Me.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode
    ' Get the position of the node's image.
    Dim point As New Point(node.LeftImagesX, node.TextAndImageBounds.Y)
    ' Perform image drawing.
    e.Graphics.DrawImage(overlayImage, point)
End Sub
```

## API Reference

- **`OwnerDrawNodes` Property**: This property enables node drawing in a `TreeViewAdv` control.
- **`AfterNodePaint` Event**: This event is triggered after the drawing of each node, allowing customization such as overlaying images.

### References

- **TreeNodeAdv**: Represents a node in a `TreeViewAdv` control.
- **TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs**: Provides data for the `AfterNodePaint` event.
