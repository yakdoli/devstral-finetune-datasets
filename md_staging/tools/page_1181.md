# ControlBar Client Controls

A ControlBar is capable of hosting two controls.

- A main control that occupies the ControlBar's client region.
- A CaptionControl that is displayed within the ControlBar's caption region.

While just about any `System.Windows.Forms.Control` instance can be used as the ControlBar's main client, the caption control position is normally occupied by single line controls such as a toolbar, text box, or combo box.

## Content

### Overview
- This page explains the functionality of the ControlBar in Syncfusion Winforms, detailing how it hosts two specific controls.

### Main Control
- The main control occupies the primary area of the ControlBar, serving as the primary interface area for user interactions.

### CaptionControl
- The CaptionControl is typically a tool bar, text box, or combo box, placed within the caption region of the ControlBar.

### Example Application
The following image illustrates the use of a ControlBar with a client control in a Windows Forms application.

ControlBar controlBar = new ControlBar();

// Adding a main control
