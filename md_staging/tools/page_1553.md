### Animation Settings

This section demonstrates how to display a splash image with animation.

When animation is set for the splash image, by default, the splash image will be drawn from left to right.

| SplashPanel Property | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AnimationSpeed       | Indicates the speed at which the animation unfolds on the screen and the SplashPanel becomes visible. |
| ShowAnimation        | Specifies if the window display should be animated.                                           |
| ShowAsTopMost        | Specifies if the SplashPanel is to be displayed as a topmost window.                          |

**This can be achieved through code also. Create a SplashPanel and set the below properties.**

#### Code Examples

```csharp
this.splashPanel1.AnimationSpeed = 30;
this.splashPanel1.ShowAnimation = true;
this.splashPanel1.ShowAsTopMost = true;
```

```vb
Me.splashPanel1.AnimationSpeed = 30
Me.splashPanel1.ShowAnimation = True
Me.splashPanel1.ShowAsTopMost = True
```

### Sliding Style

The splash image can not only be displayed from left to right, but can be displayed in different styles using the property given below.

| SplashPanel Property | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Property Name]       | Description pending or not mentioned in the provided text.                                    |
