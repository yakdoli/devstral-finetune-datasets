## Adding Nodes into the TreeViewAdv using Keyboard

The nodes can be added to the TreeViewAdv when any key is pressed, whereby the text of the node reflects the key that has been used for adding the node, by using the following code in the TreeViewAdv KeyDown event handler.

---

## Code Examples

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) {
    // Assuming sender is a TreeViewAdv instance
    TreeViewAdv treeView = sender as TreeViewAdv;

    // Ensure shift key is not pressed
    if (e.Shift) { return; }

    // Additional logic to handle modifications or conditions can be added here
    int InsertIndex = treeView.HotTreeNode == null ? treeView.Nodes.Count : treeView.HotTreeNode.Index + 1;

    // Create and insert a new TreeNode with the pressed key's text
    treeView.Nodes.Insert(InsertIndex, new TreeNode(e.KeyCode.ToString()));
    treeView.HotTreeNode = treeView.Nodes[InsertIndex];
    e.Handled = true;
}
```
