### Border3DStyleChanged Event Handling

#### Example in C#

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(" Border3DStyleChanged event is raised ");
}
```

#### Example in VB.NET

```vb
' Set the BorderStyle property to 'Fixed3D' to view the 3D border style.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.BorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.Fixed3D
' Set the 3D border style for the StatusBarAdvPanel control using the Border3DStyle property.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.Border3DStyle = System.Windows.Forms.Border3DStyle.Bump

' Handle the Border3DStyleChanged event.
AddHandler Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.Border3DStyleChanged, AddressOf statusBarAdvPanel1_Border3DStyleChanged

Private Sub statusBarAdvPanel1_Border3DStyleChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at runtime, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" Border3DStyleChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```
