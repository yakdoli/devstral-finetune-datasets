### Node Level Style

**Setting a Common Style for all the Nodes in a Level**

TreeView lets you add node level styles using the BaseStyles Collection Editor. This enables customization of the appearance of all nodes at a specific level in a structure.

#### Visual Example

![ChildStyle with Verdana, 8, Bold set for Parent2 Node](image.png)

**Figure 1475:** ChildStyle with Verdana, 8, Bold set for Parent2 Node

This figure demonstrates the application of a specific style (Verdana, 8, Bold) to the child nodes of `Parent2`. It visually illustrates how node-level styling can be utilized to enhance the readability and thematic consistency of a TreeView control.
