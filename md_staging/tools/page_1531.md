### Setting up the SplashControl

The `HostForm` property of the `SplashControl` should be set to the current form to ensure that the splash screen is displayed over the form. The `HideHostForm` property should be set to `True` to hide the host form when the splash screen is displayed.

Here is the code for setting up the `SplashControl` in both C# and VB.NET:

#### C#

```csharp
this.splashControl2.HostForm = this;
this.splashControl1.HideHostForm = true;
this.splashControl1.HostFormWindowState = System.Windows.Forms.FormWindowState.Normal;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.splashControl2.HostForm = Me
Me.SplashControl1.HideHostForm = True
Me.SplashControl1.HostFormWindowState = System.Windows.Forms.FormWindowState.Normal
```
