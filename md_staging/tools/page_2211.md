# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to enable OwnerDrawNodes and customize the ForeColor of specific nodes in a tree view.
- Includes code examples in both C# and VB.NET for implementing node customization.
- Illustrates the use of the `BeforeNodePaint` event to modify node appearance.

## Content

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
this.treeViewAdv1.OwnerDrawNodes = true;
// Enabling Node's Foreground
private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeNodePaint(object sender, TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Node.Index == 2 | e.Node.Index == 4)
    {
        e.ForeColor = Color.Red;
    }
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.treeViewAdv1.OwnerDrawNodes = True
' Enabling Node's Foreground
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeNodePaint(ByVal sender As Object, _
    ByVal e As TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs)
    If e.Node.Index = 2 Or e.Node.Index = 4 Then
        e.ForeColor = Color.Red
    End If
End Sub
```

#### Active Node Foreground Settings

The `SelectedNodeForeColor` property allows you to customize the appearance of the selected node in the tree view.

## API Reference

- **Property**: `OwnerDrawNodes`
  - **Type**: `bool`
  - **Description**: Enables or disables owner drawing of nodes. When set to `true`, the `BeforeNodePaint` event is raised before each node is drawn, allowing customization of the node's appearance.
  
- **Event**: `BeforeNodePaint`
  - **Signature**: `private void treeViewAdv_BeforeNodePaint(object sender, TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs e)`
  - **Parameters**:
    - `sender`: The object that raised the event.
    - `e`: Instance of `TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs` providing details about the node being painted.
  - **Description**: Occurs before a node is painted, allowing customization of its appearance.

- **Property**: `SelectedNodeForeColor`
  - **Type**: `Color`
  - **Description**: Gets or sets the foreground color of the selected node.

## Code Examples (multi-language)

The provided code examples demonstrate how to use the `BeforeNodePaint` event to change the `ForeColor` property of specific nodes in a tree view control.
