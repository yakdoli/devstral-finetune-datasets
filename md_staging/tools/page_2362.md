## 3.2.1.6.3 How to Programmatically control the Page Sequence?

In many cases, the user will need to customize the order in which pages display. The Wizard control provides events for doing this.

There are two ways to programmatically control the page sequence.

### Example Scenario

Say you have a three page wizard and there is a checkbox on the first page. If the checkbox is checked, you are on the first page, and you press the Next button, you require the wizard to skip the middle page and go directly to the last page. Likewise, if the checkbox is checked, you are on the last page, and you press the Back button, you need to skip the middle page and go back to the first page. If the checkbox is left unchecked, navigation using the buttons will move through all three pages.
