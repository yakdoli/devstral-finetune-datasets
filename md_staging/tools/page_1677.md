## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Quick Access ToolBar

Quick Access ToolBar can host items in it to make a more easy and efficient access to the items. The RibbonControlAdv supports full customization of Quick Access ToolBar at runtime.

### Ribbon Panel

The RibbonPanel can have various tabitems with the ability to scroll the tabs. The RibbonPanel can have three different states such as Expanded, Collapsed, and floating state while expanded.

The TabItems in the RibbonPanel can auto align the controls when the width of the RibbonControl is reduced.
