## How to keep highlighting the selected node when TreeViewAdv loses focus

We can set **HideSelection** property to **false**, to ensure that the node remains selected even when the TreeViewAdv control does not have focus.

### Code Example

#### C#

```vb
this.treeViewAdv1.HideSelection = false;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.treeViewAdv1.HideSelection = False
```

## How to Count all the Nodes of the TreeViewAdv

The user can get the total number of nodes by calling the **GetNodeCount** method with the bool argument, which indicates whether the count includes the sub trees or not. If the value passed is true, then it will count the nodes with the sub trees also.

### Code Example

#### C#

```csharp
private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // Call the tree controls "GetNodeCount" method with true to
    // get the total number of nodes in the tree.
    int TotalNodesInTree = this.treeViewAdv1.GetNodeCount(true);
    MessageBox.Show("Total nodes in tree = " + 
    TotalNodesInTree.ToString());
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As
```
