## Overview

The `SplitContainerAdv` is a container control that consists of two panels with a splitter between them. It allows users to easily place other controls on these panels and resize them by dragging the splitter vertically or horizontally. Users can add more `SplitContainerAdv` controls into one of the panels within another `SplitContainerAdv` control, and they can change the orientation to achieve a customized look.
