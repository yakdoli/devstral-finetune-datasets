## Content

We can also display the popup at a particular location.

### Code Example: C#

```csharp
[C#]

this.popupControlContainer1.ShowPopup(new Point(100, 100));
```

### Code Example: VB.NET

```vb
[VB.NET]

Private Sub richTextBox1_MouseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs)
    Me.popupControlContainer1.ShowPopup(Point.Empty)
End Sub
```

At run time, right-click on the RichTextBox, and the popup will be shown below the RichTextBox as in the following image:

### 3.5.6.1.5.5 How to Get Around this Behavior?

In order to work around this behavior, you can set a boolean flag and cancel the BeforeCloseUp event as shown below.
