# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Configuring child controls in a Windows Forms application.
- Centering child controls horizontally and vertically.
- Enabling and working with Constrained FlowLayout in a container.
- Rearranging controls laid out by FlowLayout.

## Content

### 3.6.4.4.2 Configuring Child Controls Constraints on FlowLayout

#### Constraints on FlowLayout

Constrained FlowLayout is typically useful when creating resizable data entry forms filled with textboxes, checkboxes, and so on. During design time, the constraints can be specified for each Child control through its extended **Constraints on flowLayout** property. The constraints in the FlowLayout are described below in detail.

#### Setting the Constraints Through Designer

##### HAlign and VAlign

The alignment of the Child controls that have been placed within a row can be set using the properties given below. The alignment is done based upon the layout modes of the Child controls.

| Child Control Constraints | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| HAlign                   | Specifies the mode in which the Child control should be laid out within a row. <br> <br> The options include are as follows. <br> - Left, <br>- Right, <br>- Center and <br>- Justify. |
| VAlign                   | Specifies the mode in which the Child control should be laid out within a column. <br> <br> The options include are as follows. <br> - Top, |

## API Reference (if applicable)
- Refer to Syncfusion documentation for detailed information on specific methods, properties, and events related to FlowLayout and child control alignment.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- Integration and configuration of FlowLayout in a form can be achieved through various C# code examples such as setting constraints programmatically or using the Designer tool.

## Cross References
