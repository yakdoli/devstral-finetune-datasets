## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

- **Layout Manger package** enables various layouts like Border Layout, Card Layout, Flow Layout, Grid Layout, and Grid Bag Layout.
- **XP Menus framework** allows you to create elegant menus and menu items on the toolbar, which supports multi-level cascading menus as in Microsoft Office. It is capable of creating multiple menus on a single form. Additional features like adding separators between the bar items, grouping the items, etc., are supported.
- **Custom Colors** can be applied for GroupBar control.
- **Controls under notification package** can be completely customized using their display and appearance properties.
- **TabControlAdv** provides an easy way to navigate through tabs. By setting TabPrimitives (previously, TabControlAdv's NavigationControl property), users can traverse between tabs and pages easily, enabling them to go to the next or previous tab/page and first/last tab. Close buttons can be added which closes the active tabpage when clicked, and the dropdown with all the tabpages listed can be accessed by the user to select the tabpage to be traversed. NavigationControl offers more flexibility that allows you to change the button's image, show/hide certain buttons, and also cancel the navigation and use it as an Add or Remove TabPages through code.
- **TabbedMDI** supports a wide range of Tab Styles and Window Styles. Windows in the TabbedMDI framework can be arranged in four different styles such as horizontal, vertical, cascade, and inside the client area of the parent form. It also provides advanced features to set the styles for the DropDown Menus and Context Menus.
- **TreeViewAdv control** is available with enhanced performance by reducing the loading time of the nodes by displaying the nodes only on demand by the user. This provides the user to delay the loading of nodes in Trees, until the user initiates the nodes to expand.
- **TreeNodeAdv** has now provided the option to enable multiline text for each node by using the Multiline property which is available for individual nodes. This can be set through NodeCollection Editor and it has to be set for individual nodes. This feature is available for both TreeView and MultiColumnTreeView controls.
- **The Wizard control** allows the user to add/remove the pages at design-time very easily by using verbs or by WizardControl Page Collection editor. You can also easily add images, title, and description for the wizard control.
- **The RibbonControlAdv** comes with the Office MenuButton with the desired image. The visibility of this OfficeMenuButton can also be toggled during runtime. This OfficeMenuButton can have SuperToolTips associated with it.
- **SuperToolTip control** enables the user to give tooltip information using this control. The SuperToolTip can have three segments, Header, Body, and Footer to display the content. The SuperToolTip control supports high-level customization of its appearance through the properties available for colors, Images, and Text.
