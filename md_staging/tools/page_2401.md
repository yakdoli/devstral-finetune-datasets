Here are some of the most common questions that may arise, regarding the usage and functionality of Essential Tools-Windows:

- **How to modify the existing source code given by Syncfusion and use the modified code in my application?**

All the Syncfusion dlls are signed with the Syncfusion's private key. Hence, to use a modified source code, the Syncfusion Source code has to be built with your company private key, for all the dependencies.

#### Example: For Tools.Windows
You will be using the following dll list:
1. Syncfusion.Core
2. Syncfusion.Shared.Base
3. Syncfusion.Grid.Base
4. Syncfusion.Tools.Base
5. Syncfusion.Shared.Windows
6. Syncfusion.Grid.Windows
7. Syncfusion.Tools.Windows

The source of the dlls listed above can be found under the following path:
```
${install_drive}:\\Program Files\\Syncfusion\\Essential Studio\\${version}
```

#### Modifying AssemblyInfo.cs files
Make the following modifications to the AssemblyInfo.cs files of each source:

**[C#]**
```csharp
<assembly: AssemblyDelaySign(false)>
<assembly: AssemblyKeyFile(@"c:\keys\my_company_pri_key.snk")>
```
