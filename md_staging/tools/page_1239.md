# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Explains the usage of MainFrameBarManager methods for saving and loading toolbar/menu states.
- Describes how to save and load user-customized information using the AppStateSerializer class.
- Discusses serialization options, including binary format, MemoryStream, XML format, isolated storage, and Windows Registry.
- Provides a step-by-step guide on persisting toolbar/menu states across multiple applications.

### MainFrameBarManager Methods and Their Descriptions

| MainFrameBarManager Methods | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| SaveBarState                | Saves the current toolbars/menus state information to the specified persistence medium. |
| LoadBarState                | Reads the previously serialized toolbar/menus states. |
| SaveCustomData              | Saves the user customized information such as save/load custom bar items, which were created and added during application runtime. |
| LoadCustomData              | Loads the user customized information that was saved previously. |

The Bar State can be saved/loaded using the AppStateSerializer class, and it can be used across multiple applications.

The default serialization option is isolated storage, and the System.IO.IsolatedStorage routines normally store application-specific encrypted entries under the 'C:\Documents and Settings\[USER name]\Local Settings\Application Data\IsolatedStorage' folder. All of the Essential Tools framework components use the 'Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization.AppStateSerializer' class in the Shared library for Read/Write. The AppStateSerializer is fully documented and can be initialized for different persistence mediums such as XML / Binary files, XML / Binary streams, and the Win32 Registry using its API.

#### Serializing Bar States

The Bar States can be serialized in the following formats:

1. Binary Format
2. MemoryStream
3. XML format
4. Isolated Storage
5. Windows Registry

### Persisting Bar State in Binary Format

To serialize in Binary Format, use the following code.

#### Code Example: Serializing in Binary Format

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization;
```
