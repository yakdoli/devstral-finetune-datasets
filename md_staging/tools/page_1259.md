//Popup event handled before the popup is displayed
private void parentBarItem1_Popup(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    if (sender is ParentBarItem)
    {
        ParentBarItem barItem = sender as ParentBarItem;
        Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text + " Popup.");
    }
    else
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item Popup.");
}
```

#### PopupClosed Event

The `PopupClosed` event is handled after the popup is closed. The following code snippet demonstrates how to handle this event:

//Popup event handled after the popup is closed.
private void parentBarItem1_PopupClosed(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    if (sender is ParentBarItem)
    {
        ParentBarItem barItem = sender as ParentBarItem;
        Console.WriteLine(barItem.Text + " PopupClosed.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown Item PopupClosed.");
    }
}
```
