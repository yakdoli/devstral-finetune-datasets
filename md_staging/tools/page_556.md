#### Setting Interaction between ComboDropDown and TreeView

1. Create a handler for the ComboDropDown's **DropDown** event and the TreeView's **DoubleClick** event. In the DoubleClick event, set the combo's text based on the selected node as follows.

```csharp
[C#]

private void treeView1_DoubleClick(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    if (this.treeView1.SelectedNode != null)
    {
        // Set the combodropdown's text to be the TreeNode's text.
        this.comboDropDown1.Text = this.treeView1.SelectedNode.Text;
    }
}
```
