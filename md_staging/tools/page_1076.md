## Overview
- This page discusses the `Anchor` property in Windows Forms, detailing its functionality and options for aligning a component within a grid layout.
- It shows how different anchor settings affect the positioning of buttons in a `GridBagLayout` sample.
- Includes a visual representation of buttons with various `Anchor` settings and a note on anchoring within the child control's layout area.

### Anchor Property
The `Anchor` property specifies the justification of a component within its available layout bounds (a cell in the virtual grid). The default value is set to 'Center'.

The options include:
- Center
- North
- NorthEast
- East
- SouthEast
- South
- SouthWest
- West
- NorthWest

#### Example of Anchor Settings
The following screenshot shows the same four buttons with different anchor settings:
- Button1 is set to 'NorthEast'.
- Button2 is set to 'South'.
- Button3 is set to 'East'.
- Button4 is set to 'NorthWest'.
