1. Now run the application.
2. If the `AutoMode` property is set to `'False'`, the splash screen will have to be invoked explicitly by calling the `ShowSplash()` method.
3. Handle the `SplashClosed` event to do your processing after the splash screen is closed.

## API Reference

- **Properties**
  - `AutoMode`: Determines whether the splash screen is displayed automatically or requires explicit invocation.
  - `SplashClosed`: Event that occurs after the splash screen is closed.

- **Methods**
  - `ShowSplash()`: Invokes the splash screen explicitly when `AutoMode` is set to `'False'`.

## Code Examples

### Example: Handling the `SplashClosed` Event

```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Example of handling the SplashClosed event
    this.SplashClosed += new System.EventHandler(this.Form1_SplashClosed);
}

private void Form1_SplashClosed(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Perform processing after the splash screen is closed
    MessageBox.Show("Splash screen has been closed.");
}
```
