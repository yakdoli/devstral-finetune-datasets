## Tools for Windows Forms

The `StatusBarAdv` control can be displayed with a 2D or 3D border. Their styles are defined using the `BorderSingle` and `Border3DStyle` properties.

The color of the 2D border can be customized.

### Themes

Themes can be enabled for the `StatusBarAdv` control. This automatically resets the `BorderStyle` property to 'None'.

The `IgnoreThemeBackground` property, when set to 'True', ignores the theme's background color and draws the `StatusBarAdv` with the backcolor instead.

### Sample Path

A sample which demonstrates the `StatusBarAdv` is available in the below sample installation path.

```

```
