# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- It demonstrates the use of FlowLayout and GridBagLayout Managers to position child controls inside panels.

## Content

### Nested Layout Manager Sample

#### Figure 704: Child Controls Added to the Form

- The image illustrates a form with two panels (Panel1 and Panel2) and various buttons arranged in a nested layout structure.

#### Steps to Implement Nested Layout

- **Include the required namespace.**

  **[C#]**
  ```csharp
  using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;
  ```

  **[VB.NET]**
  ```vb
  Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools
  ```

- **Declare instances for FlowLayout and GridBagLayout Managers.** 
  - FlowLayout is used for aligning the Child components of Panel2 (which contains button4 to button8).
  - GridBagLayout is used for aligning the Child components of Panel1 (which contains button1, button2, button3, and Panel2).

  **[C#]**
  ```csharp
  private Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.GridBagLayout gridBagLayout1;
  ```

## API Reference

### Namespaces and Managers
- **Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools**
