### GroupView's BringItemIntoView Method

The `BringItemIntoView` method can be used to scroll down to a hidden item and bring that item into view.

The following code snippet illustrates this.

```csharp
[C#]
this.gridView1.SelectedItem = 20; 
// This will scroll to Item 20.
this.gridView1.BringItemIntoView(20);
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
Me.gridView1.SelectedItem = 20
' This will scroll to Item 20.
Me.gridView1.BringItemIntoView(20)
```

### 3.9.3 XPTaskBar

#### Overview

The `XPTaskBar` control simulates the new TaskBar feature popularized in Windows XP. The `XPTaskBar` is the encompassing control that can show one or more `XPTaskBar Boxes`. Each Box can in turn show user clickable command items represented by the `XPTaskBar Item` type. The box can also take a single child panel inside which you can drop any custom control. It also provides keyboard navigational support.

Popularized in XP, this look-and-feel can be the exact theme look when this control is `ThemesEnabled`. This control, however, can be used in any Operating System where it falls back to some specified color settings. The boxes are also collapsible, just like in XP.

You can then add one or more `XPTaskBar Items` to the boxes using their `Items` property.

The following screen shot illustrates the `XPTaskBar` and its elements.
