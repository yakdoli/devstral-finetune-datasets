### Deactivated Event

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_Deactivated(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    'The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Deactivated Event is raised ")
End Sub
```

## FillSplitterPaneChanged Event

The FillSplitterPane property of a TreeViewAdv control is the one that toggles support for using the control inside a dynamic splitter window and sharing scrollbars with the parent window. The FillSplitterPaneChanged event will be raised when this property is changed.

### C#

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_FillSplitterPaneChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("FillSplitterPaneChanged Event is raised ");
}
```

### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_FillSplitterPaneChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    'The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("FillSplitterPaneChanged Event is raised ")
End Sub
```
