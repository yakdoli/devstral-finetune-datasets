#### 3.11.2.2.1 Through Designer

The **SplashControl** provides full support for the Windows Forms designer.

1. **Drag and drop the SplashControl from the toolbox onto the form.**  
   The SplashControl will be created in the components area of the form.

2. **Set the SplashImage and the TimerInterval properties through the property grid.**

3. **Set the AutoMode property.**  
   This property controls how the SplashControl will be invoked. If the AutoMode property is set to 'True', the SplashControl will automatically launch itself during the parent form's load event.

4. **The SplashPanel can also be viewed at design time using the Preview Splash option by clicking the smart tag as shown below.**
