## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Overview
- Demonstrates customizing the `BottomBorderHeight` for a tabbed MDI manager.
- Involves extending the `TabbedMDIManager` class to modify visual properties of the tab host and MDI tab panel.
- Uses C# code to illustrate how to override specific methods and properties for customization.

#### Customizing Border Height in Tabbed MDI
The following figure illustrates a custom tabbed MDI manager where the `BottomBorderHeight` is explicitly set to `10` pixels.

##### Implementation Details
The customization is achieved by extending the `TabbedMDIManager` class and overriding specific methods to return modified instances of `TabHost` and `MDITabPanel`. The code below demonstrates how this can be implemented:

```csharp
[C#]

public class TabbedMDIManagerExt : TabbedMDIManager
{
    public TabbedMDIManagerExt() : base() { }

    public TabbedMDIManagerExt(IContainer container): base(container) { }

    protected override TabHost CreateTabHost()
    {
        TabHost tabHost = base.CreateTabHost();

        // Sets the Height in pixels.
        tabHost.BottomBorderHeight = 10;
        tabHost.BottomBorderColor = Color.SlateBlue;

        return tabHost;
    }

    protected override MDITabPanel CreateMDITabPanel()
    {
        MDITabPanel tabPanel = base.CreateMDITabPanel();
        tabPanel.ActiveTabColor = Color.PowderBlue;

        return tabPanel;
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Code
- **TabHost Customization**: 
  - The `CreateTabHost` method overrides the base implementation to set the `BottomBorderHeight` to `10` pixels and the `BottomBorderColor` to `SlateBlue`.
- **MDITabPanel Customization**:
  - The `CreateMDITabPanel` method customizes the active tab color to `PowderBlue`.

#### Summary
This example effectively showcases how to customize the visual appearance of a tabbed MDI manager in Windows Forms applications using Syncfusion controls. By extending the base class and overriding specific methods, developers can tailor the user interface to meet their specific requirements.

### API Reference

#### Classes
- **TabbedMDIManagerExt**
  - Inherits from `TabbedMDIManager`.
  - Extends functionality to customize `BottomBorderHeight`, `BottomBorderColor`, and `ActiveTabColor`.

#### Methods
- `CreateTabHost()`
  - Returns a modified `TabHost` instance with custom `BottomBorderHeight` and `BottomBorderColor`.
- `CreateMDITabPanel()`
  - Returns a customized `MDITabPanel` instance with a specific `ActiveTabColor`.

#### Properties
- **BottomBorderHeight**: Sets the height of the bottom border in pixels.
- **BottomBorderColor**: Sets the color of the bottom border.
- **ActiveTabColor**: Sets the color of the active tab.

### Code Examples

The provided C# code demonstrates the complete implementation of a custom tabbed MDI manager with a custom `BottomBorderHeight` and `BottomBorderColor`. This example can be adapted for various customization needs in Windows Forms applications.
