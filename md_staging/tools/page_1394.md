#### 3.9.2.4.3 Image Settings of GroupView
This section describes the image options available for GroupView.

To add images to the GroupView, the `ImageList` control must be added to the form with images. The `ImageList` control can contain large or small images, and these can be set using the properties given below.

**Note:** If the application requirements deem that the GroupView will always display the same-sized image, then it is sufficient to assign just one `ImageList`. For the VS.NET toolbox interface, the GroupView will use only a single 16x16-sized small image list.

#### GroupView Properties

| GroupView Properties | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| LargeImageList        | It contains large images (32x32) to associate with the control. |
| SmallImageView         | In SmallImageView mode, the GroupView items are displayed using the small 16x16 images and are right-aligned with the text. When the `SmallImageView` property is set to 'False', items are displayed using the larger 32x32 images and will be center-aligned with the text drawn below the image. |
| SmallImageList        | It contains small images (16x16) to associate with the control. The `SmallImageView` must be set to use these images. |
