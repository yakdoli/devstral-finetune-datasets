### Layout Mode

#### Figure 673: Layout Mode set to "Vertical"

The image shows a sample FlowLayout window with three buttons arranged vertically. The properties pane indicates the LayoutMode is set to "Vertical," along with other settings such as HorzNearMargin and Modifier directions.

### ParticipateInLayout

Child controls can be prevented from being laid out using the FlowLayout Manager. This can be achieved using the following methods:

| Method                   | Description                                                                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GetParticipateInLayout   | Indicates whether the component is in the layout list.                                    |
| SetParticipateInLayout   | Adds or removes the specified control from the layout list.                              |

#### Code Example

The following code can be used to add or remove the Child control from the FlowLayout list programmatically:

```csharp
this.flowLayout1.SetParticipateInLayout(this.button1, false);
```

```vb
Me.flowLayout1.SetParticipateInLayout(Me.button1, False)
```
