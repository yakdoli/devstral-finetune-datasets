### Code Example: State Serialization

```csharp
AppStateSerializer aser = new AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.BinaryFmtStream, ms);
this.tabbedMDIManager.SaveTabGroupStates(aser);
aser.PersistNow();

// To Load
AppStateSerializer aser = new AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.IsolatedStorage, ms);
this.tabbedMdiManager.LoadTabGroupStates(aser);
```

```vb
' To Save
Dim ms As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream()

Dim aser As AppStateSerializer = New AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.BinaryFmtStream, ms)
Me.tabbedMdiManager.SaveDockState(aser)
aser.PersistNow()

' To Load
Dim aser As New AppStateSerializer(SerializeMode.BinaryFmtStream, ms)
Me.tabbedMdiManager.LoadTabGroupStates(aser)
```
