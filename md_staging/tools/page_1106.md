##### 3.7.3.1.1 Adding Bar Items to a BarManager
To add `BarItems` (menu items) to the menu `Bar` (note that this step will NOT automatically populate menus and toolbars) during design-time:

- **Drag-and-drop** one of the `BarManagers`, `MainFrameBarManager` (for top-level forms) or `ChildFrameBarManager` (for MDIChild forms), onto the form. This will add it to the component tray.
- To access the **Customize dialog**, **right-click** the component and select the **Customize...** option or choose the **'Customize...'** option from the smart tag.

## API Reference (if applicable)
- Not explicitly detailed in the given text but can include reference to `BarManager`, `MainFrameBarManager`, `ChildFrameBarManager`, and related properties and methods.
