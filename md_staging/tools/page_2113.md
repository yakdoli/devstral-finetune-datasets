### Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The reordering of tab pages can be prevented by implementing the below code snippet. For this derive a class from TabbedMDIManager and override the `MDITabPanel` property and set the `UserMoveTabs` property of `MDITabPanel` to `True`.

```csharp
// Derive a class from TabbedMDIManager.
// Override MDITabPanel property.
// Set MDITabPanel's UserMoveTabs property to False.
tabPanel.UserMoveTabs = false;
```

```vb.net
' Derive a class from TabbedMDIManager.
' Override MDITabPanel property.
' Set MDITabPanel's UserMoveTabs property to False.
tabPanel.UserMoveTabs = False
```

### 3.18.4.7 How to remove the Context Menu for a particular tab

This can be achieved by handling the `BeforePopup` event of `TabbedMDIManager.ContextMenu`. Before that, we should know which tab is currently active. To keep track of this, `SelectedIndexChanged` event of `MDITabPanel` can be used.

First handle the `TabControlAdded` event of `TabbedMDIManager`. Then subscribe to the `args.TabControl.SelectedIndexChanged` event (where `args` is the argument passed into this event). In the `SelectedIndexChanged` event handler, store the `SelectedTab` in a variable which is accessible by all the methods inside that class. In the `BeforePopup` event, check for the `TabPageAdv` and cancel the context menu by setting `e.Cancel = true`.

In this example, we are going to remove context menu for the pages which are having the text as 'New Document'.

```csharp
// Declare the object st to store SelectedTab with enough scope.
TabPageAdv st = new TabPageAdv();
// Handles the TabControlAdded event of TabbedMDIManager.
void tmmTabControlAdded(object sender, TabbedMDITabControlEvents.Args args)
```
