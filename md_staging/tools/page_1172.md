## Figure 788: BarItem Context Menu Highlighting Begin a Group option

This section discusses the customization options available for toolbar items in the `XPToolBar`. The context menu displayed in the figure shows a feature to begin a new group within the toolbar, allowing for a structured and organized layout of toolbar buttons.

### 3.7.4.1.4.4 Adding Separators

#### Overview
- XPMenus allows you to add separators in between the items in a Toolbar, enhancing organization and visual clarity.
- Separators can also be added between menu items under a `ParentBarItem`, providing better segmentation within menus.

#### Content

- **Separators for menu items in ParentBarItem Through Designer**
  
  To add separators between the menu items under a `ParentBarItem` using the Designer:
  
  1. **Using Int32 Collection Editor**
     - Invoke the **Int32 Collection Editor** via the `ParentBarItem.SeparatorIndices` property.
     - This property allows you to specify the positions at which separators should be added within the menu structure.
  
  **Example:**
  
  ```csharp
  // Example of setting separators using SeparatorIndices
  ParentBarItem parentBarItem = new ParentBarItem();
  parentBarItem.SeparatorIndices = new int[] { 2, 5 };
  ```

  **Explanation:**
  
  - The `SeparatorIndices` array specifies the positions where separators should be added. In the example above, separators will be added after the second and fifth items.
