### Hiding the SplashPanel

In both C# and VB.NET, you can hide the `SplashPanel` by calling the `HideSplash()` method.

```csharp
[C#]
// To hide the SplashPanel call the HideSplash() method.
this.splashPanel1.HideSplash();
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
' To hide the SplashPanel call the HideSplash() method.
Me.splashPanel1.HideSplash()
```

### ShowSplashDialog()

This method is used to display the `SplashPanel` as a modal dialog during runtime. When this method is called, the user will not be able to interact with the application until the `SplashPanel` is closed. This is the main difference between the `ShowSplash()` method and `ShowSplashDialog()`.

#### Parameters

The parameters discussed for the method are as follows.

| Parameters | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| OwnerForm   | Represents the owner form. |
| Location    | Specifies the location at which the SplashPanel will be displayed. |

The `SplashPanel` will be displayed at the position/location specified in this method. By passing a new instance of the owner form to this method, we can display the `SplashPanel` as a modal dialog.

#### Example

The below example uses a button click event to call this method. This method is overloaded.

```csharp
[C#]
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.splashPanel1.ShowDialogSplash(new Point(700, 700), new Form1());
}
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs
```

### Displaying the SplashPanel as a Modal Dialog

To display the `SplashPanel` as a modal dialog, you can pass a new instance of the owner form to the `ShowDialogSplash` method. This ensures that the user cannot interact with the application until the `SplashPanel` is closed.

## Code Examples

Example demonstrating the use of `ShowDialogSplash` method.

### C# Example

```csharp
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.splashPanel1.ShowDialogSplash(new Point(700, 700), new Form1());
}
```

### VB.NET Example

```vbnet
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs
```
