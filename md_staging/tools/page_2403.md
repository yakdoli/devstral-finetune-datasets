### Builder Steps for `Syncfusion.Shared.Base`

6. Modify the `AssemblyInfo.cs` settings in all the source files. For details, refer to the **Modifying AssemblyInfo.cs files** topic.

7. Build the `Syncfusion.Shared.Base` project.

**Note:** Following two projects are available in the project folder:
1. `*_2005.csproj` - Will be useful when used in Visual Studio 2005.
2. `*_2008.csproj` - Will be useful when used in Visual Studio 2008.

8. Move the `Syncfusion.Shared.Base` dll to a separate location.

9. Drag and drop the dll in the GAC.

10. Select the `PublicKeyToken` check box.

**Note:** The public key token should have been changed, based on your company private key.

The `Syncfusion.Shared.Base` dll is successfully built.

**Steps 6-9** mentioned above can be repeated to build all the `Tools.Windows` related Syncfusion assembly references (refer the dll list) required for the project, in order.

### Approach 2: Using Build Manager

The dlls can also be built using a Build Manager. This avoids the need to create the dlls one by one. Follow the instructions provided below to build dlls using Build Manager:

1. Modify the `AssemblyInfo.cs` settings in all the source files. For details, refer **Modifying AssemblyInfo.cs files** topic.

2. Open Dashboard → Assembly Management → Run Assembly Manager.

**Note:** The Syncfusion Assembly Manager (Version) window is displayed.

3. Under the Actions group box, click Remove all versions.

4. Click Perform Action.

## Code Examples

### Example: Modifying `AssemblyInfo.cs`

```csharp
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("MyAssembly")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("My description")]
[assembly: AssemblyConfiguration("Release")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("My Company")]
[assembly: AssemblyProduct("My Product")]
[assembly: AssemblyCopyright("Copyright © 2023 My Company")]
[assembly: AssemblyTrademark("")]
[assembly: AssemblyCulture("")]
```
