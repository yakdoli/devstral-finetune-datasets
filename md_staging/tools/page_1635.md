# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## 3.11.5.4.3 AnimationDirectionChanged Event

### Overview
- This event is triggered when the value of the `AnimationDirection` property changes.
- The `AnimationDirection` property determines the direction of the animation for the marquee style.
- The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

### Content
The `AnimationDirectionChanged` event is fired whenever the `AnimationDirection` property value is modified. This property specifies the direction of the animation for the marquee style. Below is an example of how to handle this event in C#:

```csharp
[C#]

// Specify the direction of animation for the marquee style.
this.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDirection = 
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.MarqueeDirection.Right;
// Set the IsMarquee property to 'True' to activate the animation.
this.statusBarAdvPanel1.IsMarquee = true;

// Handle the AnimationDirectionChanged event.
this.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDirectionChanged += new 
    EventHandler(statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDirectionChanged);

// Start the animation.
private void Form1_Load_1(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.statusBarAdvPanel1.StartAnimation();
}

// Stop the animation.
private void button1_Click_1(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.statusBarAdvPanel1.StopAnimation();
}

private void statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDirectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" AnimationDirectionChanged event is raised ");
}
```

### VB.NET Example
The same functionality can be implemented in VB.NET as follows:

```vb
[VB.NET]

' Specify the direction of animation for the marquee style.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDirection = _
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.MarqueeDirection.Right
' Set the IsMarquee property to 'True' to activate the animation.
Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.IsMarquee = True

' Handle the AnimationDirectionChanged event.
AddHandler Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.AnimationDirectionChanged, _
    AddressOf statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDirectionChanged

' Start the animation.
Private Sub Form1_Load_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.StartAnimation()
End Sub

' Stop the animation.
Private Sub button1_Click_1(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.statusBarAdvPanel1.StopAnimation()
End Sub

Private Sub statusBarAdvPanel1_AnimationDirectionChanged(ByVal sender As Object, _
    ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" AnimationDirectionChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### API Reference
- **Namespace**: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools
- **Event**: AnimationDirectionChanged
- **Handler**: EventHandler
- **Property**: AnimationDirection
- **Property**: IsMarquee

### Code Examples
The examples provided demonstrate how to configure and handle the `AnimationDirectionChanged` event for a `statusBarAdvPanel` control in both C# and VB.NET. The event is triggered when the `AnimationDirection` property changes, allowing developers to respond to changes in the animation direction dynamically.
