## Overview
- This segment focuses on demonstrating how to use MDI (Multiple Document Interface) functionality in a Windows Forms application, showcasing how Form2 can be displayed as a tabbed form inside Form1.
- The example provides C# and VB.NET code snippets for setting up the MDI structure and shows the expected output when the application is run.
- Emphasizes the use of the `MdiParent` property to integrate multiple forms into a parent form.

### Using MDI to Display Forms
The following instructions require modifying the `Form1_Load` event to include a code snippet that creates and displays `Form2` within `Form1` as a tabbed document.

#### Step 3: Modify the Form1_Load Event
**C# Code:**
```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    Form2 frm = new Form2();
    frm.MdiParent = this;
    frm.Show();
}
```

**VB.NET Code:**
```vb
Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    Dim frm As Form2 = New Form2
    frm.MdiParent = Me
    frm.Show()
End Sub
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
After implementing the code above, run the application to observe the following behavior:

- You will see `Form2` tabbed inside `Form1`.
- The tabbed interface allows for easy navigation between MDI child forms.

#### Visual Example

### Explanation of Code
- **`Form2 frm = new Form2();`**: Creates an instance of `Form2`.
- **`frm.MdiParent = this;`**: Sets the parent form (`Form1`) as the MDI parent for `Form2`.
- **`frm.Show();`**: Displays the `Form2` as a child form inside `Form1`.

This setup ensures that multiple forms can be managed within a single top-level form, providing a structured and user-friendly interface.

## API Reference
- **Namespace**: System.Windows.Forms
- **Class**: Form
- **Property**:
  - `MdiParent`: Sets the MDI parent form for a child form.
  
### Parameters
| Name        | Type           | Description                                                                 | Default  | Required |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| MdiParent   | Form           | The form that will be considered the MDI parent for the current form.    | null     | Yes      |

### Returns
None.

## Code Examples
- **C# Example**: Demonstrates creating a Form2 as an MDI child within Form1.
- **VB.NET Example**: Equivalent VB.NET implementation for the same functionality.
