# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```csharp
// Save Bar State in Binary format
// You can also use BinaryFmtStream instead of Binaryfile
AppStateSerializer app = new AppStateSerializer(Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization.SerializeMode.BinaryFile, "Barstate");
this.mainFrameBarManager1.SaveBarState(app);
app.PersistNow();
```

```vb
' Save Bar State in Binary format
' You can also use BinaryFmtStream instead of Binaryfile
Private app As AppStateSerializer = New AppStateSerializer(Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization.SerializeMode.BinaryFile, "Barstate")
Me.mainFrameBarManager1.SaveBarState(app)
app.PersistNow()
```

```vb
Imports Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization

' Load Bar State in Binary format
' You can also use BinaryFmtStream instead of Binaryfile
Private app As AppStateSerializer = New AppStateSerializer(Syncfusion.Runtime.Serialization.SerializeMode.BinaryFile, "Barstate")
Me.mainFrameBarManager1.LoadBarState(app)
```

## Persisting Bar State in Memory Stream

To persist the information in a database, we need to serialize the state into a memory stream. After which the stream is written into the database. The field to where the bar state is saved is binary.

## Storing State

```csharp
// Saving Bar state to memory stream
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
```
