# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The `SplashControl` provides an easy way to use classes that can be used to display splash screens. The `SplashControl` can be dragged and dropped onto your form from the controls toolbox. The `SplashControl` is implemented as a component that is not visible at run time. It is visible in the component area of your form where you can select it and set its properties.

## Features

### Overview

This section outlines the features of the `SplashControl` that facilitate the display of splash screens in Windows Forms applications.

#### Key Features
- **Splash Settings**: Configurable settings for automatic launch, text display, and time interval.
- **SplashPanel Settings**: Customizable properties for splash screen behavior.

- **Time Interval**: The duration for which the splash screen is displayed can be customized based on user requirements.

#### Example Usage

The `SplashControl` can be utilized as follows:

1. Drag and drop the `SplashControl` from the toolbox onto your form.

// Create an instance of the SplashControl
SplashControl splashControl = new SplashScreen();

splashControl.SplashText = "Welcome to the Application!";

// Set the duration for which the splash screen will be displayed
splashControl.Interval = 3000; // 3 seconds

// Automatically show the splash screen on form load
