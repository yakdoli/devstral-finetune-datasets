## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The TabbedMDI framework will retain the MDI scheme in Tabbed mode. The Child forms will still be MDIChildren of the Parent (they will not be moved into a TabControl; this results in loss of MDI functionality like Merged Menus, switching using CTRL+TAB, etc.), thereby enhancing your application without interfering with the general MDI scheme.

The TabbedMDI framework provides users the exact functionality and look and feel of Visual Studio .NET Tabbed Child windows.

### 3.18.1 Features Overview

The TabbedMDI framework contains the TabbedMDIManager control with features to create rich user applications.

#### Features

- **Styles** - TabbedMDI supports a wide range of Tab Styles and Window Styles. Windows in the TabbedMDI framework can be arranged in four different styles such as horizontal, vertical, cascade, and inside the client area of the parent form. It also provides advanced features to set the styles for the DropDown Menus and Context Menus.
- **Tab Alignment** - Aligns the Tabs to the Top, Left, Right, or Bottom using the Alignment property. To access this property, the TabControlAdded event is used.
- **Tab Groups** - Tab Groups are resizable exactly as in the Visual Studio .NET IDE. The number and layout of the Tab Groups can be restricted and controlled.
- **MDI List** - The list of MDIChild Forms in the application can be retrieved by using a single property. Also, the Menu Item or ToolStrip Menu Item to which the list should be added can be specified.
- **Button Settings** - Options to add DropDown and Close buttons are available. Close buttons can be displayed individually for each tab. The color of the close button can be set according to the needs of the user. It also provides options to close tabs on clicking the middle button of the mouse.
- **Appearance Settings** - User Controls, Images, and Icons can be added to the Tabs. Options are provided to customize the tab's text and image and control the tab's image size.

Themed tabs can be displayed using the `ThemesEnabled` property.
