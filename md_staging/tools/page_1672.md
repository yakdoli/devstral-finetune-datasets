### Explanation of Demonstrated Properties

- `DisplayDates`: A Boolean property that determines whether the date is displayed on the `DigitalClock`.
- When set to `true`, the `DigitalClock` displays the date and weekday below the time.
- When set to `false`, only the time is displayed without the date or weekday.

### Conclusion

By utilizing the `DisplayDates` property, developers can customize the `DigitalClock` control to include or exclude the display of dates and weekdays, enhancing its functionality to suit various application requirements.
