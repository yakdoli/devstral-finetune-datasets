### Overview of Layout Manager

#### Layout Manager

The Layout Manager is the base type of all components, providing a basic layout management framework over which the individual managers build on. It provides fundamental information on the five layout managers included in this package which are listed below.

#### BorderLayout

This Layout Manager will layout the Child controls along the borders and at the center, just like the .NET framework's built-in docking support.

#### CardLayout

This Layout Manager shows one Child control at a time in a Container.

#### FlowLayout

This Layout Manager will layout the Child components horizontally or vertically in a specific order, based on constraints. FlowLayout is one of the most commonly used Layout Managers.

#### GridLayout

This Layout Manager will layout Child controls in the form of a grid containing rows and columns.

#### GridBagLayout

This Layout Manager will layout the Child controls in a virtual grid of rows and columns. But, unlike the GridLayout, the size of the columns / rows can be varied and the children may span more than one cell.
