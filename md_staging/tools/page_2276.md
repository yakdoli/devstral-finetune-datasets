### WinForms-specific Mouse Events Handling

#### [VB.NET]
```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.CancelMouseEventArgs)
    ' Returns the MouseEventArgs data for this event
    Console.Write("Mouse Button :" & e MouseEventArgs.Button.ToString() & " No of clicks" & e MouseEventArgs.Clicks.ToString() & " Delta value" & e MouseEventArgs.Delta.ToString() & " Location of the mouse" & e MouseEventArgs.Location.ToString() & " X cor" & e MouseEventArgs.X.ToString() & " Y cord:" & e MouseEventArgs.Y.ToString())
    ' Cancel the event using the below code.
    e.Cancel = True
End Sub
```

#### ScrollControlMouseMove Event

The event `MouseMove` is raised when the mouse pointer is moved over the control. The `ScrollControlMouseMove` event occurs before a `MouseMove` event is raised and allows you to cancel the mouse event.

##### Event Data

The event handler receives an argument of type `CancelMouseEventArgs` containing data related to this event. The following `CancelMouseEventArgs` members provide information specific to this event.

| Members       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cancel       | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the event should be canceled.      |
| MouseEventArgs | Indicates the `MouseEventArgs` data for this event.                      |

#### [C#]
```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseMove(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.CancelMouseEventArgs e)
{
}
```
