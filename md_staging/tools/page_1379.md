## GroupView Control Customization

### Flat Look

The `FlatLook` property allows changing the border of a GroupView to a different appearance. It can be set to `True` to remove the 3-dimensional edge.

### Border Style

The `BorderStyle` property gets or sets the border style for the GroupView control. It includes the following options:
- None
- FixedSingle
- Fixed3D

#### Code Examples

##### C#

```csharp
this.groupView1.FlatLook = true;
this.groupView1.BorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle;
```

##### VB.NET

```vb
Me.groupView1.FlatLook = True
Me.groupView1.BorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle
```

## Illustration

The border of the GroupView items can be changed by setting the `FlatLook` property to `True`, resulting in a flat look. Refer to Figure 933 for an illustration:
