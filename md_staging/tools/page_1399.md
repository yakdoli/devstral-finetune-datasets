' VB.NET
Me.groupView1.ThemesEnabled = True

#### 3.9.2.4.5 Interactive Features

User can determine whether the particular GroupView Item is selected or not using the ButtonView and ClipSelectionBounds properties. ButtonView displays the selected GroupView Item in the pressed state.

ButtonView can be enabled in the GroupView control at design-time by setting the SelectedItem property to integer values which in turn represents the GroupView Item. ClipSelectionBounds displays a white border around the selected GroupView Item.
