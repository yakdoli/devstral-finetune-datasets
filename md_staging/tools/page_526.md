The .NET framework provides a color dialog control to allow applications to collect color information from users. However, the color dialog control does not provide any way to place a control within the layout of the application to collect color information. The Essential Tools ColorPickerUIAdv provides an easy to use color palette control that can be placed inline in your applications.
