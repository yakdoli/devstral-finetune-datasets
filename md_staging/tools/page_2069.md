# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

```csharp
[C#]

public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    this.tb = new TabbedMDIManager();
}
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

Public Sub New()
    tb = New TabbedMDIManager()
End Sub
```

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to implement Tabbed MDI functionality using the TabbedMDIManager.
- Highlights the steps to attach the TabbedMDIManager to an MDI container and display child forms as tabs.

---

### Steps to Implement Tabbed MDI

1. **Attach TabbedMDIManager to Form1 (MDIContainer)**:
   - Ensure that `Form1`'s `IsMdiContainer` property is set to `True`.
   - This enables the TabbedMDI mode, grouping any new MDIChild forms as tabs.

2. **Switch to Design View and Add a New Form**:
   - Add a new form (Form2) to the application.

3. **Include Code in Form1_Load Event**:
   - Write the code snippet provided below to create and display Form2 within Form1.

### Code Example

#### C#
```csharp
[C#]

private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    this.IsMdiContainer = true;
    this.tb.AttachToMdiContainer(this);
    Form2 frm = new Form2();
    frm.MdiParent = this;
    frm.Show();
}
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
[VB.NET]

Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    Me.IsMdiContainer = true
    Me.tb.AttachToMdiContainer(Me)
    Dim frm As Form2 = New Form2
    frm.MdiParent = Me
    frm.Show()
End Sub
```

4. **Run the application**:
   - You will see Form2 tabbed inside Form1.

## Conclusion
- By following the steps outlined, you can effectively integrate Tabbed MDI functionality into your Windows Forms application using Syncfusion components.

---

## API References
- **TabbedMDIManager**: A component that provides tabbed MDI functionality.
- **IsMdiContainer**: A property of the MDI parent form that must be set to enable MDI mode.
- **AttachToMdiContainer**: A method to attach the TabbedMDIManager to the MDI parent form.

## Code Examples
- **C# and VB.NET**: Provided above demonstrate initializing the TabbedMDIManager and attaching it to the MDI container.
