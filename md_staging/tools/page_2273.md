### `ScrollControlHandledMouseUp Event`

The event `MouseUp` is raised when the mouse pointer is over the control and a mouse button is released. Once this event is raised, the `ScrollControlHandledMouseUp` event will also be triggered.

#### Event Data

The event handler receives an argument of type `MouseEventArgs` containing data related to this event. The following `MouseEventArgs` members provide information specific to this event:

| Members | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Button | Gets which mouse button was pressed. |
| Clicks | Gets the number of times the mouse button was pressed and released. |
| Delta | Gets a signed count of the detents the mouse had rotated, whereas a detent is one notch of the mouse wheel. |
| Location | Gets the location of the mouse during generating mouse events. |
| X | Gets the X-coordinates of the mouse during generating mouse events. |
| Y | Gets the Y-coordinates of the mouse during generating mouse events. |

### Code Example

```csharp
Console.Write("X coordinate :" + e.X.ToString())
'This returns the Y coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
Console.Write("Y coordinate :" + e.Y.ToString())
End Sub
```
