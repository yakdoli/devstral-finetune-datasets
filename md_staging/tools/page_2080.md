# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The tabs in the TabbedMDI layout can be aligned to the Top, Left, Right, and Bottom of the form using the `Alignment` property. To access the `Alignment` property, you should use the `TabControlAdded` event. This event is fired to let the user configure the tab appearance and behavior.

## Attaching the TabControlAdded Event

### Step 5: Call the TabControlAdded Event in the Form's Constructor

#### C#

```csharp
this.tb.TabControlAdded += new TabbedMDITabControlEventHandler(tb_TabControlAdded);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
AddHandler tb.TabControlAdded, AddressOf tb_TabControlAdded
```

### Step 6: Set the Alignment Property of Tab Control using the TabbedMDITabControlEventArgs

#### C#

```csharp
private void tb_TabControlAdded(object sender, TabbedMDITabControlEventArgs args)
{
    args.TabControl.Alignment = TabAlignment.Bottom;
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub tb_TabControlAdded(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As TabbedMDITabControlEventArgs)
    args.TabControl.Alignment = TabAlignment.Bottom
End Sub
```

## API Reference

The following APIs are relevant to this functionality:

- **`TabbedMDITabControlEventArgs`**  
  Contains the event data for the `TabControlAdded` event.

- **`TabControl.Alignment`**  
  Property to set the alignment of the tab control. Possible values include `Top`, `Left`, `Right`, and `Bottom`.

- **`TabbedMDITabControlEventHandler`**  
  EventHandler for the `TabControlAdded` event.

### Summary

By leveraging the `TabControlAdded` event, the `Alignment` property can be configured dynamically to change the position of tabs in the TabbedMDI layout, providing flexibility in UI design.
