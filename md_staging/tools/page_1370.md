## 3.9.2 GroupView

- **Overview**:
  - The GroupView control implements a selectable list that can display a collection of items, where each item is represented by an image and a descriptor.
  - The GroupView control's appearance and behavior attributes are extensively customizable, making it possible to create a wide range of interfaces such as lists with large / small images, regular / flow view, button type selection, flat look and selective item highlighting / underlining.

```vb
' Example highlighting the usage of GroupView.
