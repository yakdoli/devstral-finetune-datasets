# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses the layout and distribution of space using `GridBagLayout` in Windows Forms.
- It explains how `WeightX` and `WeightY` settings affect the distribution of horizontal and vertical space between child controls.

## Content

### GridBagLayout in Action

#### Figure 696: Buttons with 0 WeightX and WeightY
- **Caption**: Displays a grid layout where four buttons (button1, button2, button3, and button4) are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
- **Description**: Each button has `WeightX` and `WeightY` set to 0, resulting in minimal distribution of space.

#### Figure 697: Buttons with Custom WeightX and WeightY
- **Caption**: Illustrates a grid layout where the child controls' `WeightX` and `WeightY` values are customized.
- **Description**: The space is redistributed based on the following settings:
  - **button1**: (2, 1)
  - **button2**: (1, 2)
  - **button3**: (1, 1)
  - **button4**: (1, 1)
- **Horizontal Distribution**: The horizontal space is distributed between the 1st and 2nd column in the ratio 2:1.
- **Vertical Distribution**: The vertical space is distributed between the two rows in the ratio 2:1.

## API Reference
- **GridBagLayout**: A layout container that distributes space using horizontal and vertical weights.
- **WeightX**: A property that defines the horizontal weight of the child control.
- **WeightY**: A property that defines the vertical weight of the child control.
- **Fill.Both**: Specifies that the child control should fill both horizontally and vertically.

## Code Examples

### Layout Configuration Example
```csharp
// Setting up GridBagLayout with custom WeightX and WeightY
GridBagLayout layout = new GridBagLayout();

button1.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
button1.GridBagConstraints = new GridBagConstraints();
button1.GridBagConstraints.WeightX = 2;
button1.GridBagConstraints.WeightY = 1;

LayoutPanel = new Panel();
LayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button1);
LayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button2);
LayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button3);
LayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button4);

LayoutPanel.Layout = layout;
```
