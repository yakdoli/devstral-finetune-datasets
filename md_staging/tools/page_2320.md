### Wizard Control Setup

#### Code Example
```vb
[VB.NET]
Me.wizardControl1.WizardPages = New 
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.WizardControlPage() 
(Me.wizardControlPage1, Me.wizardControlPage2, Me.wizardControlPage3) 
Me.wizardControl1.SelectedWizardPage = Me.wizardControlPage2
```

#### Properties Configuration
- **FullPage**: Set this property to `True` for `WizardControlPage1` to hide the header portion in the first page.
- **BackVisible**: For the first wizard page, set this property to `False` to hide the back button since it is not needed on the first page.

#### Property Grid Example
The image shows the property grid of `WizardControlPage1` with the following key settings:
- **BackVisible**: `False`
- **FullPage**: `True`

#### Output Description
The output will reflect the configuration applied, as follows:
- The first wizard page will have its header hidden due to the `FullPage` property being set to `True`.
- The back button will be hidden on the first page since `BackVisible` is set to `False`.

## Code Examples
The code snippet provided demonstrates how to initialize the wizard control and configure its pages. This includes setting the pages and defining the selected page programmatically.

## Summary
By adjusting the `FullPage` and `BackVisible` properties of `WizardControlPage1`, the user can customize the appearance and behavior of the wizard control to meet specific design requirements, such as hiding headers and back buttons on the first page.
