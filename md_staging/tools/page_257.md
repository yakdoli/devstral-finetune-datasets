### 3.4.4.3.2 How to determine whether any two controls are in the same tabbed group?

This can be done by calling the `IsSameTabbedGroup` method.

```csharp
this.dockingManager.IsSameTabbedGroup(this.listBox1, this.listBox2);
```

```vbnet
Me.dockingManager.IsSameTabbedGroup(Me.listBox1, Me.listBox2)
```

### 3.4.4.3.3 How to get the docking group details?

#### To get the docking group

There is no concept of 'group' in Docking Manager, and a tabbed group is just an intermediate state. However, if necessary, this can be determined by first ascertaining that the control is in a tabbed docking group, getting hold of the `DockTabController`, getting its `DockTab`, and then iterating the `DockTabPages`. The `dhcClient` member of each `DockTabPage` will reference the `DockHostController` that is associated with it. Once the controller is available, you can get to the control through the `DockHostController.HostControl` property and use the control's `Controls[0]` indexer to get the actual dockable control.

Follow the given steps to get the docking group.
