### FlowLayout

#### 3.6.4.4 FlowLayout

**FlowLayout** is a Layout Manager which allows us to arrange the Child components horizontally or vertically in a specific order, based on the settings. FlowLayout is one of the most commonly used Layout Managers. Deriving from the LayoutManager class, the FlowLayout component was created to support simple horizontal and vertical flow and complex constraint-based FlowLayouts.

In its simplest form, this Layout Manager can be used to automatically arrange the Child components in one or more rows, as shown below.

## Code Examples
- Example of using `FlowLayout`:
```csharp
public class LayoutPanelExample
{
    public void InitializeForm()
    {
        Form form = new Form();
        FlowLayoutPanel flowLayoutPanel = new FlowLayoutPanel();
        flowLayoutPanel.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.LeftToRight;

        Button button1 = new Button();
        button1.Text = "Button 1";
        flowLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button1);

        Button button2 = new Button();
        button2.Text = "Button 2";
        flowLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button2);

        Button button3 = new Button();
        button3.Text = "Button 3";
        flowLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(button3);

        form.Controls.Add(flowLayoutPanel);
