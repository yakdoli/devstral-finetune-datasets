# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

This section discusses the configuration of layout managers for Windows Forms applications using Syncfusion tools. The focus is on setting margins and configuring various layout options such as BorderLayout, FlowLayout, and GridLayout. Additionally, it covers child control settings, particularly the PreferredSize property in .NET controls.

### BorderLayout

**Figure 658: Margins set for Layout Manager (BorderLayout)**

This figure shows the arrangement of child controls in a BorderLayout, highlighting how margins are set within the manager. The layout configuration includes:
- Top
- Left
- Right
- Bottom

### Layout Manager Configuration

- **Configuring BorderLayout**: Learn how to configure BorderLayout for optimal space distribution. 
- **Configuring FlowLayout**: Customize the flow direction and spacing between child controls.
- **Configuring GridLayout**: Specify the number of rows and columns for a grid-based layout.

### 3.6.4.1.3 Child Control Settings

#### Overview

The Child control settings for the Layout Managers are designed to enhance the flexibility and control over the placement and sizing of components within a form. These settings allow developers to manage the visual structure of their applications more precisely.

#### Size

The **Preferred Size** property plays a crucial role in determining how child controls are positioned by various Layout Managers. The following sections explain how to configure and utilize this property.

#### Preferred Size

The Layout Managers typically arrange components based on their preferred sizes. However, .NET controls do not inherently provide information about their preferred size. To address this, the **PreferredSize** extended property is provided for each Child control during design time.

| Methods             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SetPreferredSize    | Associates a preferred size with the specified control.                     |
| GetPreferredSize    | Retrieves the preferred size associated with the specified control.         |

##### Code Implementation

In code, you can manage the preferred size of controls using the methods listed below:

```csharp
