## Content

### SplashPanel Properties

| SplashPanel Property | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| AllowMove           | Indicates whether the `SplashPanel` can be moved by the user at run time. |
| AllowResize         | Indicates whether the `SplashPanel` can be resized by the user at run time. |
| CloseOnClick        | Indicates whether the `SplashPanel` gets closed when the user clicks on it. |

#### Behavior of Properties

When the `AllowMove` property is set to `True`, the user will be allowed to click within the `SplashPanel` and move the `SplashPanel` on the screen.

When the `AllowResize` property is set to `True`, resize handles will be displayed when the user moves the mouse near the border of the `SplashPanel`.

**Note:** In the above cases, the `splash panel` will not be closed, until the host form is closed.

The user can also close the `SplashPanel` by a single mouse click. This feature can be enabled by setting the `CloseOnClick` property to `True`.

#### Sample Code

**C#**
```csharp
this.splashPanel1.AllowMove = true;
this.splashPanel1.AllowResize = true;
this.splashPanel1.CloseOnClick = true;
```

**VB.NET**
```vb
Me.splashPanel1.AllowMove = True
Me.splashPanel1.AllowResize = True
Me.splashPanel1.CloseOnClick = True
```

### Border Settings
