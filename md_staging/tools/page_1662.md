#### 3.11.6.4 Digital Clock

The DigitalClock is implemented as an extension to the existing Clock control in the UI controls, but offers a richer UI experience than the existing clock and is capable of displaying the time as digital text.

You can use the DigitalClock in your application by simply switching the ClockType of the existing ClockControl as described in the following sample code:

```csharp
this.clock1.ClockType = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.ClockTypes.Digital;
```

```vb
Me.clock1.ClockType = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.ClockTypes.Digital
```

#### 3.11.6.4.1 Appearance

The DigitalClock offers a wide range of options to customize its appearance. It provides three built-in frames and five background shapes. Users can also use their own frames for the DigitalClock through the renderer.
