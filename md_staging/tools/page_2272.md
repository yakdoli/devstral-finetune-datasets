## Overview
- The page provides code examples showcasing the handling of mouse events in a `TreeViewAdv` control.
- Demonstrates how to capture and display the button pressed, click count, mouse delta value, and mouse location.

### Handling Mouse Events in C#

The following code snippet in C# demonstrates how to handle the `ScrollControlHandledMouseMove` event for a `TreeViewAdv` control, printing information about the mouse event.

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // This code prints mouse button that is pressed.
    Console.Write("Button :" + e.Button.ToString());

    // This returns the no of times the mouse button was pressed.
    Console.Write("Clicks :" + e.Clicks.ToString());

    // This print the Delta value.
    Console.Write("Delta value :" + e.Delta.ToString());

    // This returns the location of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Location :" + e.Location.ToString());

    // This returns the X coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("X coordinate :" + e.X.ToString());

    // This returns the Y coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Y coordinate :" + e.Y.ToString());
}
```

### Handling Mouse Events in VB.NET

The following code snippet in VB.NET demonstrates the same functionality, handling the `ScrollControlHandledMouseMove` event for a `TreeViewAdv` control.

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_ScrollControlHandledMouseMove(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)

    ' This code prints mouse button that is pressed.
    Console.Write("Button :" + e.Button.ToString())

    ' This returns the no of times the mouse button was pressed.
    Console.Write("Clicks  :" + e.Clicks.ToString())

    ' This print the Delta value.
    Console.Write("delta Value :" + e.Delta.ToString())

    ' This returns the location of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Location :" + e.Location.ToString())

    ' This returns the X coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("X coordinate :" + e.X.ToString())

    ' This returns the Y coordinates of the mouse while generating mouse events.
    Console.Write("Y coordinate :" + e.Y.ToString())
End Sub
```
