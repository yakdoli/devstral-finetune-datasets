### Note
The `RefreshRegionFromImage()` method can be used to refresh the region from the background image.

#### Behavior Settings

The user will not be able to close or resize the splash image, which is displayed during runtime, normally. But by setting certain properties of the SplashPanel, the user can alter the SplashPanel. These properties are explained below in detail.
