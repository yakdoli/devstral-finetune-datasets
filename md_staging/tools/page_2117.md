### Customizing MDITabPanel

#### VB.NET

To customize the MDITabPanel, inherit from `TabbedGroupedMDIManager` and override the `CreateMDITabPanel` method to return a custom `MDITabPanel`. Below is the VB.NET implementation:

```vb
Public Class CustomTabbedMDI : Inherits TabbedGroupedMDIManager
    Public Sub New()
        End Sub

    Protected Overrides Function CreateMDITabPanel() As MDITabPanel
        Return New CustomMDITabPanel(Me)
    End Function
End Class

Public Class CustomMDITabPanel : Inherits MDITabPanel
    Public Sub New(ByVal tm As TabbedMDIManager)
        MyBase.New(tm)
    End Sub

    Protected Overrides Function GetCloseButtonBounds() As Rectangle
        Dim rect As Rectangle = MyBase.GetCloseButtonBounds()
        rect.Width = 20
        rect.Height = 20
        Return rect
    End Function
End Class
```

### Changing the Backcolor of Active and Inactive Tabs

#### 3.18.4.10 How to change the backcolor of Active and Inactive tabs

You can change the tab back color for active tabs and inactive tabs using `ActiveTabColor` and `InactiveTabColor` properties. The following code snippet illustrates this.

#### C#

```csharp
private void tabbedMDIManager_TabControlAdded(object sender, TabbedMDITabControlEventArgs args)
{
    args.TabControl.ActiveTabColor = Color.Red;
    args.TabControl.InactiveTabColor = Color.Green;
}
```

#### VB.NET

Attributes and properties related to tab customization, such as `ActiveTabColor` and `InactiveTabColor`, are demonstrated here.

## Code Examples

The examples provided include both C# and VB.NET implementations for customizing the appearance of tabbed MDI panels and changing the backcolors of active and inactive tabs.
