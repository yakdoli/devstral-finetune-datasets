### 3.21.3.2.1 Selection Settings While Drag Drop

When performing a drag and drop operation, the behavior of node selection during the operation can be customized using the following properties of the TreeViewAdv control:

#### Key Behavior Description
- **KeepDottedSelection**: When set to `true`, the selected node will be drawn with a dotted rectangle when it loses focus.
- **KeepDragCapturePoint**: When enabled, the semi-transparent image that appears beside the cursor during a drag operation can be displayed at a distance from the mouse cursor.
- **ShowDragNodeCue**: Controls whether the semi-transparent image of the selected node is shown or hidden during the drag and drop operation.
