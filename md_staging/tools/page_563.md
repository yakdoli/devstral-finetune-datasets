# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Demonstrates customizing a ComboBox control using VB.NET inheritance.
- Introduces `ComboBoxAdv`, an advanced ComboBox control with additional features.

## Content

### Customizing ComboBox Drop-Down

VB.NET allows inheriting from the `ComboBoxDropDown` class to customize the behavior of a ComboBox control. Below is an example demonstrating how to draw a transparent selection in the drop-down list.

```vb
Public Class CustomCombODropDown : Inherits ComboBoxDropDown
    Public Sub New()
        End Sub

    Protected Overrides Sub DrawListModeEditPortion(ByVal e As PaintEventArgs, ByVal highlightBG As Color, ByVal highlightText As Color, ByVal drawFocusRect As Boolean)

        ' Set the highlightBG to Color.Transparent to draw transparent selection.
        ' Set drawFocusRect to false to hide the focus rectangle.
        MyBase.DrawListModeEditPortion(e, Color.Transparent, highlightText, False)
        End Sub
End Class
```

### **3.5.5.2 ComboBoxAdv**

**ComboBoxAdv** is an advanced combo box control that provides a similar object model as the framework of ComboBox control, but with additional features. `ComboBoxAdv` is inherited from `ComboBoxBaseDataBound`, which is derived from the `ComboBoxBase` control.

**ComboBoxAdv** pre-binds a list box in its drop-down area and includes additional API to enhance the functionality of a combo box-like object model and data binding support. It exposes the text box and list box controls used internally, allowing customization of different parts of the control.
