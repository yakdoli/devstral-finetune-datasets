# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

You can implement Microsoft Internet Explorer style auto completion with ease using the Auto Complete control.

- Multiple target controls can use the same Auto Complete control and data source.
- It provides Auto Complete support to Text Box, ComboBox and user controls that embeds an edit control.
- It can be bound to [DataSource](https://www.syncfusion.com/).
- AutoComplete functionality can also be provided for RichTextBox control.
- It is possible to format the text in a standard Text Box control that uses an AutoComplete component based on the data source of the AutoComplete.
- We can hide the close button, gripper and column header in the AutoComplete DropDown. See [Header, Close Button and Gripper](https://www.syncfusion.com/docs/windowsforms/tutorials/autocomplete/header-close-button-and-gripper) to know more.
- We can set width for AutoComplete DropDown.
- We can add [multiple columns](https://www.syncfusion.com/docs/windowsforms/tutorials/autocomplete/multiple-columns) for AutoComplete DropDown.
- It supports serialization of history items to the Windows Registry, Isolated Storage or the File System.
- We can also do custom matching i.e., we can override the default matching of the current content of the target edit control.

### 3.5.1.1.2.1 Through Designer

This tutorial illustrates the usage of the AutoComplete control for TextBox, without any external data source.

1. Create a new Windows Forms application and open the main form for the application in the designer. Add the Syncfusion controls to the VS .NET toolbox, if you have not done so already. Drag-and-drop an AutoComplete control onto the form.
