### 3.11.3.3.1.3.4 Top to Bottom

If the splash panel `SlideStyle` is set as marquee and the `MarqueeDirection` is set as `TopToBottom`, the marquee will traverse the screen from the top to the bottom.

#### C#

```csharp
//Set panel slide style.
this.splashPanel1.SlideStyle = SlideStyle.marquee;

//Set panel location.
this.splashPanel1.DesktopAlignment = SplashAlignment.BottomRight;

//Set animation direction.
this.splashPanel1.MarqueeDirection = MarqueeDirection.TopToBottom;

//Show panel.
this.splashPanel1.ShowSplash();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
'Set panel slide style.
Me.splashPanel1.SlideStyle = SlideStyle.marquee

'Set panel location.
Me.splashPanel1.DesktopAlignment = SplashAlignment.BottomRight

'Set animation direction.
Me.splashPanel1.MarqueeDirection = MarqueeDirection.TopToBottom
