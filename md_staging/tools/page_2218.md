# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Explains explicit style inheritance and how to use the BaseStyle property in TreeViewAdvStyleInfo.
- Details the process of inheriting styles explicitly and editing the tree control's BaseStyles Collection Editor.
- Demonstrates standard style editing and custom style creation through the provided methods.

## Explicit Style Inheritance

Any StyleInfo instance can also inherit explicitly from a specific named StyleInfo object. This can be done using the BaseStyle property of the TreeNodeAdvStyleInfo type. As noted previously, such named styles should be available in the tree control's BaseStyles Collection Editor. You can also add custom styles using this editor.

### TreeViewAdv Properties

| TreeViewAdv Properties | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| BaseStyle                | Indicates the base style of the nodes. |

StandardStyle is the default style for the nodes. It can be edited using the StandardStyle property. It can also be edited through the BaseStyles Collection Editor dialog.

### WinForms-specific Conventions

The document adheres to C# syntax for code examples and property settings, emphasizing the designer and runtime features as described in the image.

### Design-Time vs Runtime Features

- **Design-Time**: Focuses on configuring styles using properties and the BaseStyles Collection Editor.
- **Runtime**: Involves applying these styles dynamically in the application based on user interactions and runtime conditions.
