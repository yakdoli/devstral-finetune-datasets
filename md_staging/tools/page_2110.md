## 3.18.4.3 How to browse through the MDIChildren in the MDIContainer after enabling TabbedMDIManager

You should not use the MDIContainer form's MDIChildren property to browse through the MDIChildren. This is because the TabbedMDI framework introduces some additional MDIChildren into your MDIContainer that are not part of your application logic.

You should instead use the TabbedMDIManager's **MDIChildren** property to get a list of the MDIChildren, as follows:

```csharp
// In your MDIContainer Form.
private void ParseMDIChildren()
{
    string children = String.Empty;
    foreach (Form form in this.tabbedMDIManager.MdiChildren)
    {
        children += form.Text + "\r\n";
    }
}
```

## API Reference (if applicable)

### Methods

- **ParseMDIChildren()**
  - **Description**: Iterates through the MDI children in the TabbedMDIManager.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: None.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

### C# Example

```csharp
// In your MDIContainer Form.
private void ParseMDIChildren()
{
    string children = String.Empty;
    foreach (Form form in this.tabbedMDIManager.MdiChildren)
    {
        children += form.Text + "\r\n";
    }
}
```

### VB.NET Example

```vb
' In your MDIContainer Form.
Private Sub ParseMDIChildren()
    Dim children As String = String.Empty
    For Each form As Form In Me.tabbedMDIManager.MdiChildren
        children += form.Text + vbCrLf
    Next
End Sub
```
