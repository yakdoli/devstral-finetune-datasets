# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The Rows property usually dictates the number of columns (overriding the Columns property setting) based on the number of Child controls, unless the Rows property is set to 'Null' or less, in which case the Columns property will dictate the number of rows.

The following code snippet arranges the Child controls in one column and two rows.

## C#

```csharp
this.gridLayout1.Rows = 2;
this.gridLayout1.Columns = 1;
```

## VB.NET

```vb
Me.gridLayout1.Rows = 2
Me.gridLayout1.Columns = 1
```

## HGap and VGap

The horizontal and the vertical gap between the Child controls can be set using the properties given below.

| GridLayout Property | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| HGap               | Gets / sets the horizontal spacing between the components. |
| VGap               | Gets / sets the vertical spacing between the components. |

### C#

```csharp
this.gridLayout1.HGap=10;
this.gridLayout1.VGap=10;
```

### VB.NET

```vb
Me.gridLayout1.HGap=10
Me.gridLayout1.VGap=10
```
