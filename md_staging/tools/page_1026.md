## Overview
- This page explains how to define preferred and minimum sizes for child components in Windows Forms using layout managers. It covers the use of `SetPreferredSize` and `SetMinimumSize` methods along with their VB.NET equivalents.
- It discusses the role of the `IProvideLayoutInformation` interface in determining child control sizes dynamically at runtime.

## Content

### Preferred Size

You can associate a preferred size for a Child component through the `PreferredSize` extended property. Some Layout Managers may ignore this setting; refer to individual Layout Managers for how the size impacts layout logic.

#### Code Examples

[C#]

```csharp
this.cardLayout1.SetPreferredSize(this.button1, new System.Drawing.Size(75, 92));
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Me.cardLayout1.SetPreferredSize(Me.button1, New System.Drawing.Size(75, 92))
```

### Minimum Size

You can similarly associate a minimum size for a Child component through the `MinimumSize` extended property. However, some Layout Managers may ignore this setting. Refer to the individual Layout Managers for more information on how the size plays an important part in the layout logic.

#### Methods

| Methods           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SetMinimumSize`  | Associates a minimum size with the specified control.                      |
| `GetMinimumSize`  | Retrieves the minimum size associated with the specified control.         |

#### Code Examples

[C#]

```csharp
this.cardLayout1.SetMinimumSize(this.button1, new System.Drawing.Size(75, 92));
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Me.cardLayout1.SetMinimumSize(Me.button1, New System.Drawing.Size(75, 92))
```

### Dynamic Size Information

You can also dynamically provide preferred and minimum size information for a Child component at runtime. The manner in which a Layout Manager determines the preferred size for a Child control is illustrated below:

- **Check for IProvideLayoutInformation Interface:** The layout manager checks if the Child control / component implements the `IProvideLayoutInformation` interface. If so, it calls into that interface to retrieve the preferred size.
