### Event Handling for Pop-up Controls

The following table outlines the key events associated with the Pop-up control and their corresponding descriptions:

| Events         | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `PopupClosed`  | Triggers when the Pop-up is closed      |
| `PopupClosing` | Triggers before the Pop-up closes       |

---

### C#

Below are examples of event handlers in C# for the Pop-up control:

#### Event Triggers

```csharp
// Triggers before the Pop-up displays
private void toolbarListBarItem1_BeforePopup(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("BeforePopopup event triggered");
}

// Triggers when the Pop-up is displayed
private void toolbarListBarItem1_Popup(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Popup event is triggered");
}

// Triggers when the Pop-up is closed
private void toolbarListBarItem1_PopupClosed(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("PopupClosed event is triggered");
}

// Triggers before the Pop-up closes
private void toolbarListBarItem1_PopupClosing(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("PopupClosing event is triggered");
}
```

### VB.NET

The following examples showcase event handling in VB.NET for the Pop-up control:

#### Event Triggers

```vb
' Triggers before the Pop-up displays
Private Sub toolbarListBarItem1_BeforePopup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As CancelEventArgs)
    Console.WriteLine("BeforePopopup event triggered")
End Sub

' Triggers when the Pop-up is displayed
Private Sub toolbarListBarItem1_Popup(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Console.WriteLine("Popup event is triggered")
End Sub
```

## API Reference

  - **Handler**: Implement a method to handle actions after the Pop-up is closed.

- **`PopupClosing`**
  - **Trigger**: Before the Pop-up closes.
  - **Handler**: Implement a method to handle actions or cancel the closure of the Pop-up.

## Code Examples

The code examples provided above demonstrate how to handle the `PopupClosed` and `PopupClosing` events in both C# and VB.NET. These examples print messages to the console to indicate when each event is triggered, providing a clear indication of the timing of these events.
