## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

A Sample which demonstrates the GridBagLayout is available in the below sample installation path.

#### Content
The GridBagLayout is completely configured through the GridBag Constraints set for each Child component. The number of rows and columns in the virtual grid is also derived from the specified constraints. The constraint for each Child component on the GridBagLayout can be specified through designer and programmatically.

### Setting the Constraints Through Designer

#### GridPosX and GridPosY
The primary objective in setting the constraint for a Child control is usually to determine in which cell it should be laid out.

**Note:** Multiple Child controls can occupy the same cell potentially overlapping each other.

| Child Control Constraints | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| GridPosX                  | Specifies the column in the virtual grid, where the component's layout bounds begin. The default value is set to -1. |
| GridPosY                  | Specifies the row in the virtual grid, where the component's layout bounds begin. The default value is set to -1. |

#### WinForms-specific conventions
The following screenshot shows four buttons with non-zero weights with the GridPosX and GridPosY setting as follows: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), resulting in a 2 x 2 virtual grid.
