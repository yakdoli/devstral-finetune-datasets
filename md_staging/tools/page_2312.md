# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Provides methods to manipulate TreeNodeAdv coordinates and cursor positions in relation to TreeViewAdv controls.
- Implementation in both C# and VB.NET for calculating and setting cursor positions relative to specific nodes in a TreeViewAdv.

## Content

### [C#]

```csharp
private Point MousePointer(TreeNodeAdv node)
{
    // Provides the coordinates of the top-left corner of a TreeNodeAdv in terms of screen coordinates.
    Point point = this.treeViewAdv1.PointToScreen(this.treeViewAdv1.NodeToPoint(node));
    point = new Point (point.X+node.NodeX, point.Y);
    return point;
}

private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // Coding for the cursor position when a button is clicked.
    Cursor.Position = this.MousePointer(this.treeViewAdv1.Nodes[0]);
}
```

### [VB.NET]

```vb
Private Function MousePointer(ByVal node As TreeNodeAdv) As Point
    ' Provides the coordinates of the top-left corner of a TreeNodeAdv in terms of screen coordinates.
    Dim point As Point = Me.treeViewAdv1.PointToScreen(Me.treeViewAdv1.NodeToPoint(node))
    point = New Point (point.X+node.NodeX, point.Y)
    Return point
End Function

Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles button1.Click
    ' Coding for the cursor position when a button is clicked.
    Cursor.Position = Me.MousePointer (Me.treeViewAdv1.Nodes(0))
End Sub
```

### 3.21.5.28 What is the use of Undo/ Redo functionality in TreeViewAdv using HistoryManager property?

The undo / redo functionality of a tree node lets you delete a node, add a node, edit a node's text, and drag / drop a node using the HistoryManager.

## API Reference

### Methods

- `MousePointer(TreeNodeAdv node)`
  - **Returns:** `Point`
  - **Description:** Calculates the screen coordinates of the top-left corner of a TreeNodeAdv node.

### Events

- `button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)`
  - **Description:** Handles the event when a button is clicked, updating the cursor position based on the calculated screen coordinates.

## Code Examples

### C# Example

```csharp
// Example usage of MousePointer to set cursor position
Cursor.Position = this.MousePointer(this.treeViewAdv1.Nodes[0]);
```

### VB.NET Example

```vb
' Example usage of MousePointer to set cursor position
Cursor.Position = Me.MousePointer(Me.treeViewAdv1.Nodes(0))
```

### Explanation of Undo/Redo Functionality

The `HistoryManager` property in `TreeViewAdv` allows users to revert changes such as:
- Deleting a node
- Adding a node
- Editing a node's text
- Dragging and dropping a node

This functionality is crucial for maintaining user experience and data integrity by allowing users to correct mistakes or experiment with different configurations.
