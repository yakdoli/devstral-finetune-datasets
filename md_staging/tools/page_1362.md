### GroupBarItemSelected Event

```vb
[VB.NET]
' Provide a handler for the GroupBar.GroupBarItemSelected event.
Private Me.groupBar1.GroupBarItemSelected += New
System.EventHandler(Me.groupBar1_GroupBarItemSelected)
' GroupBar.GroupBarItemSelected event handler.
' The GroupBar.SelectedItem property fetches the index of the selected
' item, while the item is obtained by referencing the selected index
' within the GroupBar.GroupBarItems collection.
Private Sub groupBar1_GroupBarItemSelected(ByVal sender As Object,
ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    Trace.WriteLine(String.Concat("Selected Item = ",
    Me.groupBar1.GroupBarItems(Me.groupBar1.SelectedItem).Text))
End Sub
```

### ShowContextMenu Event

The `ShowContextMenu` event occurs when right-clicking the mouse button over the `GroupBar` control. It is triggered when the mouse is right-clicked over the `GroupBar` control at runtime.

The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

#### Code Example in C#

```csharp
[C#]
private void groupBar1_ShowContextMenu(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // You can see the below line in the output window during run-time.
    Console.Write(" ShowContextMenu Event is raised ");
}
```

#### Code Example in VB.NET

```vb
[VB.NET]
Private Sub groupBar1_ShowContextMenu(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' You can see the below line in the output window during run-time.
    Console.Write(" ShowContextMenu Event is raised ")
End Sub
```
