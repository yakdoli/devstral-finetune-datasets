### Handling Events for Quick Access Toolbar

The `BeforeAddItem` event is triggered just before an item gets added to the Quick Access Toolbar. The `BeforeRemoveItem` event is triggered just before an item is removed from the Quick Access Toolbar.

#### C#

```csharp
private void QuickItems_BeforeAddItem(object sender, RibbonItemEventArgs e)
{
    // Gets the item that is going to be added
    MessageBox.Show(e.Item.Text.ToString() + " Item is Added");
}

private void QuickItems_BeforeRemoveItem(object sender, RibbonItemEventArgs e)
{
    // Gets the item that is going to be Removed
    MessageBox.Show(e.Item.Text.ToString() + " Item is Removed");
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vbnet
Private Sub QuickItems_BeforeAddItem(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RibbonItemEventArgs)
    ' Gets the item that is going to be added
    MessageBox.Show(e.Item.Text.ToString() + " Item is Added")
End Sub

Private Sub QuickItems_BeforeRemoveItem(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RibbonItemEventArgs)
    ' Gets the item that is going to be Removed
    MessageBox.Show(e.Item.Text.ToString() + " Item is Removed")
End Sub
```
