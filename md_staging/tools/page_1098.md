### Figure 710: Panel3 as container control with BorderLayout

The figure showcases a design with multiple panels and buttons arranged using different layout managers. Here is a brief description of the layout:

1. **Panel1**:
   - Contains `button1` and `button2`, arranged side by side.

2. **Panel2**:
   - Contains `button3`, `button4`, `button5`, and `button6`, arranged in a horizontal flow.

3. **Panel3**:
   - Contains `button7`, `button8`, `button9`, and `button10`, arranged using BorderLayout.

Each panel is contained within its own section, demonstrating the effective use of different layout strategies.

- **The final output of the application with all the Layout Managers arranged in the above said fashion is shown below.**

Panel panel3 = new Panel();
panel3布局 = new BorderLayout();

// Add buttons to the panel with positions specified for BorderLayout
Panel3.Controls.Add(button7, BorderLayout.Center);
Panel3.Controls.Add(button8, BorderLayout.South);
Panel3.Controls.Add(button9, BorderLayout.West);
Panel3.Controls.Add(button10, BorderLayout.East);
```
