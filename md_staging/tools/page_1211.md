# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the behavior of merged BarItems in MDI child forms and their visibility in runtime customization dialog and parent form's menus or toolbars.
- Explains how to explicitly merge child types using the `MainFrameBarManager`.
- Highlights the requirement for child form types to have a public default constructor for explicit merging.
- Lists the three types of MDI merging supported: Main menu, Toolbars, and BarItems.

## Content

unaffected through out the lifetime of the application (whether or not there are instances of the child types currently loaded). Note that the merged BarItems of the MDI child forms would be displayed in the runtime customization dialog only, and will not be visible in the parent form's menus or toolbars until an actual instance of the child form is loaded. This is the behavior exhibited in VS .NET. You can explicitly merge child types by registering the child form types with the `MainFrameBarManager`, as follows.

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
// TextEditorForm and ImageEditorForm are form-derived classes that are MDIChildren.
this.mainFrameBarManager1.RegisterMdiChildTypes(new Type[] { typeof(TextEditorForm), typeof(ImageEditorForm) });
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
' TextEditorForm and ImageEditorForm are form-derived classes that are MDIChildren.
Me.mainFrameBarManager1.RegisterMdiChildTypes(New Type() {GetType(TextEditorForm), GetType(ImageEditorForm)})
```

The `MainFrameBarManager` will then create an instance of these form types and obtain the main menu and toolbars associated with these child form types.

The following applies to the explicit merging scenario only:

**Warning**: Explicit merging imposes the requirement that the child form types should have a public default constructor (constructor with no arguments).

### Note

During explicit merging, a new 'dummy' instance of the child forms (one for each type) will be created by the framework in the background. However, these child forms will never be made visible.

## Types of Merging

### 3.7.4.5.1.1 Types of Merging

There are three types of MDI merging supported:

- **Main menu Merging**: MainMenus (bars with the `MainMenu BarStyle`) in the main form and the child forms will automatically be merged into one, irrespective of their `BarName`.
- **Toolbars Merging**: Toolbars with the same `BarName` (in different forms) will be merged into one.
- **BarItems Merging**: A BarItem in a child form can merge with a BarItem in the parent form, if it satisfies the following criteria.
