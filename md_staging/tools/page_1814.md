### Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar

The image (Figure 1203) shows the interface for customizing the Quick Access Toolbar. The process involves selecting an item from the list on the left and adding it to the QAT on the right. The `BeforeAddItem` event is triggered just before an item is added.

#### Figure 1203: "Paste" Item is added to the QAT and the BeforeAddItem Event is Handled just before adding the Item

**Description:**
- The user interface displays the `Customize Quick Access Toolbar` dialog.
- The available commands are listed on the left, with icons and labels such as "&New," "&Open," "&Save," "&Print," "Cut," "&Copy," "&Paste," and "Help."
- The user selects the "&Paste" item and adds it to the QAT on the right.
- The dialog box confirms the addition of the "&Paste" item with an "OK" button.

### 3.12.2.1.1.3.3.2 QuickItemAdded and QuickItemRemoved Events

#### Handling Events for QAT Items

- **QuickItemAdded Event:**
  When items are added to the QuickAccessToolBar, the `RibbonControlAdv.Header.QuickItemAdded` event is triggered.

  ```csharp
  [C#]
  this.ribbonControlAdv1.Header.QuickItemAdded += new 
      ToolStripItemEventHandler(Header_QuickItemAdded);
  ```

- **QuickItemRemoved Event:**
  Similarly, when items are removed from the QuickAccessToolBar, the `RibbonControlAdv.Header.QuickItemRemoved` event is triggered.

## API Reference

### Events
- **QuickItemAdded**
  Triggered when an item is added to the QuickAccessToolBar.
- **QuickItemRemoved**
  Triggered when an item is removed from the QuickAccessToolBar.

### Methods and Handlers
- **ToolStripItemEventHandler**
  Used to handle the `QuickItemAdded` and `QuickItemRemoved` events.

## Code Examples

### C# Example
```csharp
// Event handler for QuickItemAdded
private void Header_QuickItemAdded(object sender, ToolStripItemEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the addition of a quick item
    MessageBox.Show($"Quick item '{e.ToolStripItem.Text}' was added.");
}

// Event handler for QuickItemRemoved
private void Header_QuickItemRemoved(object sender, ToolStripItemEventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the removal of a quick item
    MessageBox.Show($"Quick item '{e.ToolStripItem.Text}' was removed.");
}
```

### Adding Event Handlers
```csharp
this.ribbonControlAdv1.Header.QuickItemAdded += new 
     ToolStripItemEventHandler(Header_QuickItemAdded);
     
this.ribbonControlAdv1.Header.QuickItemRemoved += new 
     ToolStripItemEventHandler(Header_QuickItemRemoved);
```
