## Content

### 3.11.4.4.9 VerticalGradientChanged Event

This event is fired when the value of the `VerticalGradient` property is changed. The `VerticalGradient` property indicates whether the gradient is vertical.

The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

#### C#

```csharp
private void statusBarAdv1_VerticalGradientChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" VerticalGradientChanged event is raised ");
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub statusBarAdv1_VerticalGradientChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" VerticalGradientChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### 3.11.5 StatusBarAdvPanel

The `StatusBarAdvPanel` is a panel-derived class that can display `StatusBar` information such as the time and key state with several appearance enhancements, both within a `StatusBarAdv` control and also on a form. Customizing the look and feel can be done by setting the desired properties through the property window, and usually there is no need to write any code.
