**Description:**
- **Base Styles:** The left panel lists available base styles such as `BaseStyle1`, `Standard - Subitem`, `Standard`, and `Standard - Column`.
- **Properties:** The right panel displays the properties of the selected base style (`BaseStyle1`). These properties include `Appearance`, `Font`, and other customizable attributes like `Background`, `CheckState`, and `Font`.
- **Add/Remove Styles:** The interface provides options to add or remove styles, facilitating dynamic customization.
- **Interactivity:** Users can modify properties directly, allowing precise control over UI elements.

### Applying Base Styles to Nodes
The new base style created in the editor can be applied to any of the nodes using the `TreeNodeAdv.BaseStyle` property. This property ensures that the custom styles are applied consistently across the respective nodes.

#### Code Example
```csharp
// Applying a base style to a TreeNodeAdv
TreeNodeAdv node = new TreeNodeAdv("Node");
node.BaseStyle = baseStyles["BaseStyle1"];
```

### Customization Options
The BaseStyles Collection Editor allows for extensive customization of UI elements. Properties such as `Background`, `Font`, and `CheckState` can be tailored to fit specific design requirements. This flexibility enables developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly applications.

#### Node Level Customization
Developers can define specific styles for different levels of nodes, as indicated by the options for `Node Level Style`, `Column Style`, and `Node SubItem Style`. This granular control ensures that each element can be styled independently, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Conclusion
By utilizing the BaseStyles Collection Editor, developers can efficiently manage and apply custom styles to various nodes in Windows Forms applications. This tool simplifies the process of creating cohesive and visually一致的用户界面，同时提供了强大的自定义能力。
