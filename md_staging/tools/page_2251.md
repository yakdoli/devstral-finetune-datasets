# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The page covers triggers for `GradientBackgroundChanged` and `GradientColorsChanged` events, detailing how they function in `treeViewAdv1`.

### WinForms-specific conventions
- The examples are provided in both C# and VB.NET, focusing on handling events when the background or gradient colors of a tree view control change.

#### Code Examples

```csharp
[C#]

private void treeViewAdv1_GradientBackgroundChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Gradient Background Changed Event is raised ");
}
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_GradientBackgroundChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Gradient Background Changed Event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### Explanation
- These examples demonstrate handling the `GradientBackgroundChanged` event, where a message is printed to the output window indicating the event occurrence.

## Content

### GradientColorsChanged Event

```csharp
[C#]

private void treeViewAdv1_GradientColorsChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Gradient Colors Changed Event is raised ");
}
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_GradientColorsChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' The below line will be printed in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Gradient Colors Changed Event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### Explanation
- These examples illustrate handling the `GradientColorsChanged` event, indicating when the tree view's gradient colors are altered.
