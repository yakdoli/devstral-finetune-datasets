## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### 3.15.2.1.1 Adding themes to Controls with Skin Manager at Designer Time

Once the SkinManager is applied to a parent form or container, the new controls being added to it will also be updated with the theme applied in the SkinManager.

The following images describe the same in applying the Office2007Black theme to the newly added control [ButtonAdv] after the theme is applied to the form through the SkinManager.
