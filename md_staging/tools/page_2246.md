# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Getting Started

- This section explains how to check or uncheck `TreeNodeAdv` elements using a mouse.

## Content

### Check or uncheck TreeNodeAdvs using the Mouse

This can be done by handling the `TreeViewAdv`'s `BeforeCheck` event as shown below.

#### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]

private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeCheck(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeCheckEventArgs e)
{
    if (Control.MouseButtons == MouseButtons.Left)
    {
        // Allow check or uncheck.
    }
    else
    {
        // Ignore all other ways to check/uncheck the node.
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeCheck(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeCheckEventArgs)
    If Control.MouseButtons = MouseButtons.Left Then

        ' Allow check or uncheck.
    Else

        ' Ignore all other ways to check/uncheck the node.
        e.Cancel = True
    End If
End Sub
```

### 3.21.4.3.6 Leave Event

This event is triggered when the control is no longer the active control of the form. An example which uses the Leave event is as follows.
