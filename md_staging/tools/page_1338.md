The following screenshot shows the Nested GroupBars.

## Code Examples

No code examples are provided in the image. However, this section would typically include examples of how to programmatically achieve the same result as the drag-and-drop operation, such as:

```csharp
// Assuming GroupBar1 and GroupBar2 are already instantiated
GroupBar1.Controls.Add(GroupBar2);
```
