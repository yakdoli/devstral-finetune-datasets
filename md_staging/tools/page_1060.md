### FlowLayoutPanel AutoHeight Property

1. **AutoHeight Property**: Set the FlowLayoutPanel's `AutoHeight` property to `True` to allow the panel width to adjust dynamically based on the number of rows in the layout.

#### Example Code

```csharp
[C#]

// Set the AutoHeight property of FlowLayout.
this.flowLayout1.AutoHeight = true;
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

' Set the AutoHeight property of FlowLayout.
Me.flowLayout1.AutoHeight = True
```

#### Note

> During run time, the input controls get resized and repositioned appropriately based on the constraints provided.

### AutoLabel Control

**AutoLabel Control**: The AutoLabel control is a label-derived control that lets you pair a label with any other control. Once paired, the AutoLabel will be automatically repositioned as the labeled control's position changes.
