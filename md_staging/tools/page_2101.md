### Serialization Support

#### 3.18.2.12 Serialization support

The AppStateSerializer class is a serialization utility that allows multiple components in an application to access a common disk I/O medium for state persistence. Using the same storage medium for persisting the state information across components, without overlaying them together, helps avoid the file clutter that is bound to occur by components using distinct files.

The TabGroupStates can be serialized in:

1. Binary Format
2. XML Format
3. Isolated Storage
4. Memory Stream
