### 3.5.6.3.2 Creating GradientPanelExt

This section will guide you to create a GradientPanelExt through designer and also through programmatical approach.

#### 3.5.6.3.2.1 Through Designer

The following steps are involved in creating the GradientPanelExt through the designer.

1. Create a new Windows Application.
2. Drag the GradientPanelExt from the toolbox on to the windows application form.
