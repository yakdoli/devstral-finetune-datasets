## Concepts and Features

This section discusses the concepts and features of the control under the following topics:

### 3.10.2.1 Drop-Down Selection

NavigationView control provides drop-down selection support.

Each folder that is navigated through, is shown in the Address Bar, separated by a Forward Arrow. Clicking on this arrow, will show a drop-down list, displaying all the folders directly below the one you have opened.

![Navigation View with Bars](<Figure shows a NavigationView control with an address bar indicating navigation path through folders: "MyComputer", "LocalDisk:C", and "Program Files." (Reference: Source imageâ€™s Figure 990)>)

### Overview
- NavigationView provides a user-friendly interface for navigating directories and files.
- The Address Bar displays the path of the currently selected folder, separated by Forward Arrows.
- Drop-down selection allows users to quickly view all the folders directly beneath the currently open one.

### Content

#### WinForms-specific conventions

- The NavigationView control integrates smoothly into Windows Forms applications, offering a native-like directory navigation experience.
- Key features include:
  - **Dropdown Selection**: Enables on-demand folder exploration.
  - **Integrated Address Bar**: Tracks the current directory path.

#### API Reference

The NavigationView does not have a dedicated API section in this excerpt, but the control is typically interacted with through properties like `AddressBar`, `SelectedItem`, and `Collection` to manage and visualize navigation.

### Code Examples

- **Example in C#**:
  ```csharp
  using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;

  // Create a NavigationView instance
  NavigationView navView = new NavigationView();

  // Add items to the NavigationView
  navView.Items.Add(new NavigationViewItem("Home"));
  navView.Items.Add(new NavigationViewItem("Documents"));
  navView.Items[1].SubItems.Add(new NavigationViewItem("Work"));
  navView.Items[1].SubItems.Add(new NavigationViewItem("Personal"));
  ```
