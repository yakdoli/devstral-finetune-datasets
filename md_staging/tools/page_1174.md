## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### Clear Separators

```

![Separators in Toolbar](image-of-toolbar-separators.png)

**Description:**  
The image shows examples of separators in a toolbar. The separators divide the toolbar elements and dropdown menu items for better visual clarity. Specifically, they are labeled as "Separators for ParentBarItem DropDown," indicating their placement within dropdown menus.

### 3.7.4.2 Menus Framework

This section will demonstrate the addition and customization of detached CommandBars and ControlBars.

#### 3.7.4.2.1 Detached CommandBar

The XP Menus framework provides the flexibility to add detached toolbars through `CommandBar` that can host any .NET control. These toolbars are detached from the framework in the sense that they cannot participate in user customization. Otherwise, they are seamless in look-and-feel.

#### Through Designer

To add a detached command bar in the designer:

1. Right-click on the `MainFrameBarManager` in the designer.
2. Choose the "Add Detached CommandBar" option.

### Notes

- The `CommandBar` can host any .NET control, making it versatile for various use cases.
- Detached toolbars are not customizable by the user, ensuring a uniform look and feel across the application.
