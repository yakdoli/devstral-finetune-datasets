#### SplashClosing Event
The SplashClosing event is raised when the \( \text{SplashClosingNotify()} \) method is called. This method is an implementation of the \( \text{ISplashWrapperFormListener} \) for receiving notification from the SplashWrapperForm when the splash window is closing.

**Example Code:**

- **C#**:
```csharp
this.splashControl1.SplashClosingNotify();
```

- **VB.NET**:
```vb
Me.splashControl1.SplashClosingNotify()
```

#### SplashClosed Event
The SplashClosed event is raised after the splash screen is closed. For example, in the following code, the event logs are recorded and displayed in a textbox.

- **C#**:
```csharp
// Handle the SplashClosed event.
this.splashControl1.SplashClosed += new System.EventHandler(this.splashControl1_SplashClosed);

private void splashControl1_SplashClosed(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    string eventlogmessage = String.Format("Event: {0} Object: {1}\r\n", "SplashClosed", sender.ToString());
    textBox1.Text = textBox1.Text + eventlogmessage;
}
```
