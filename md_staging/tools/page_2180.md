### Custom Cursor Usage

The following code snippet illustrates how to use custom cursors when a checkbox is checked. The cursor changes based on the effect of the drag-and-drop operation.

```csharp
' Use custom cursors if the check box is checked.
If UseCustomCursorsCheck.Checked Then
    MyNormalCursor = New Cursor("3dwarro.cur")
    MyNoDropCursor = New Cursor("3dwno.cur")
    ' Set the custom cursor based upon the effect.
    e.UseDefaultCursors = False
    If (e.Effect And DragDropEffects.Move) = DragDropEffects.Move Then
        Cursor.Current = MyNormalCursor
    Else
        Cursor.Current = MyNoDropCursor
    End If
End If
End Sub
```
