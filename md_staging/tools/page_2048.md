### Content

#### 3.17.10.17 TabsOrderChanged Event
This event occurs when the order of the tabs is changed in the `TabControlAdv`.

**C#**
```csharp
// Set the UserMoveTabs property to True, to drag and drop tabs during runtime.
this.tabControlAdv1.UserMoveTabs = true;

// Handle the TabsOrderChanged event.
this.tabControlAdv1.TabsOrderChanged += new EventHandler(tabControlAdv1_TabsOrderChanged);

private void tabControlAdv1_TabsOrderChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when a tab is dragged and dropped at another location.
    Console.Write("TabsOrderChanged event is raised");
}
```

**VB.NET**
```vb
' Set the UserMoveTabs property to True, to drag and drop tabs during runtime.
Me.tabControlAdv1.UserMoveTabs = True

' Handle the TabsOrderChanged event.
```
