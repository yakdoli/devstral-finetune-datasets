# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The state of the bar can be preserved across multiple applications in various formats.
- Features include persistence options, SuperToolTip support, and miscellaneous tools.

## Content

### Persistence Options

The bar state can be persisted across multiple applications in the following formats:

- Binary file
- XML file
- Isolated storage medium
- Windows Registry

### SuperToolTip Support

The BarItems in XPMenus provides **SuperToolTip support**. Other than the usual tooltip, XPMenus now allows users to associate a SuperToolTip to the BarItems.

### Miscellaneous Features

- Extensive **keyboard support**.
- **Visual Inheritance Support**
- **Localization support**.
- Provides a full range of events that signal your application when any toolbar or menu activity occurs.

#### Note
**SDI (Single Document Interface)** is a Windows function that allows an application to display only one document at a time. SDI requires the user to load another instance of the application to work with two or more documents.

**MDI (Multiple Document Interface)** is a Microsoft Windows programming interface for creating an application that enables users to work with multiple documents at the same time. Each document is in a separate space with its own controls for scrolling.

### Advantages

- Offers an incredible amount of flexibility over the look and feel of its controls.
- Entire product is written in 100% native C# code which fully takes the advantage of what the .NET framework has to offer.
- Easy to use.
- Applicable for both Single Document Interface (SDI) and Multiple Document Interface (MDI).
- Avoids complex coding.
