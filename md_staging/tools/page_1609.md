private void statusBarAdv1_GradientBackgroundChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" GradientBackgroundChanged event is raised ");
}
```

```vb.net

Private Sub statusBarAdv1_GradientBackgroundChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" GradientBackgroundChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```
