### GradientColorsChanged Event

```csharp
// [C#]
private void statusBarAdv1_GradientColorsChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" GradientColorsChanged event is raised ");
}
```

```vb
' [VB.NET]
Private Sub statusBarAdv1_GradientColorsChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" GradientColorsChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```

### ThemeChanged Event

#### Details
This event is fired when the value of the `ThemesEnabled` property is changed. The `ThemesEnabled` property indicates whether the `StatusBar` will draw a themed background (Indicated Settings: `BorderStyle = None`). The event handler receives an argument of type `EventArgs`.

```csharp
// [C#]
private void statusBarAdv1_ThemeChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" ThemeChanged event is raised ");
}
```

```vb
' [VB.NET]
Private Sub statusBarAdv1_ThemeChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Below line will be displayed in the output window at run-time, when this event is fired.
    Console.WriteLine(" ThemeChanged event is raised ")
End Sub
```
