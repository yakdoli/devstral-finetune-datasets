# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The Essential Tools docking framework implements the core docking interactions and additionally implements certain other complex features such as multiple docking levels, nested docking, tabbed docking, tear-off tabs, auto-hide mode, and full state persistence.

Docking Manager is the component that supports Visual Studio .NET style docking / floating windows with full design-time support. The Office 2007 visual styles in blue, black, and silver color schemes can also be applied to the docking windows.
