# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes how to set the MDIParent for a new child form in a Windows Forms application.
- Explains how to add different icons to MDI tabs programmatically using a custom approach.

## Content

### Setting the MDIParent of a New Child Form

You should set the MDIParent of the new child form as follows:

#### Code in C#
```csharp
[C#]

private void buttonAdv1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    Form3 child1 = new Form3();
    // Set the new form's MDIParent to the main form.
    child1.MdiParent = (Form1) this.Parent.Parent;
    child1.Text = "Document";
    child1.Show();
}
```

#### Code in VB
```vb
[VB]

Private Sub buttonAdv1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles buttonAdv1.Click
    Dim f1 As Form3 = New Form3()
    ' Set the new form's MDIParent to the main form.
    f1.MdiParent = CType(Me.Parent.Parent, Form1)
    f1.Text = "Document"
    f1.Show()
End Sub
```

### 3.18.4.2 How to add different icons to MDI Tabs

This can be done programmatically using the below code snippet.

#### Code in C#
```csharp
[C#]

// Derive CustomTabbedMDIManager class from TabbedMDIManager
// to expose the internal TabControlAdv.
// Override the MDITabPanel code function.
this.MdiTabPanel = tabPanel;
// Add the images to the Image List.
TabControlAdv tabcontrol = this.tabbedMdiManager.GetMdiTabPanel() as TabControlAdv;
tabcontrol.ImageList = this.imageList1;
// Assign the images to the child tabs.
foreach (TabPageAdv page in tabcontrol.TabPages)
{
```
