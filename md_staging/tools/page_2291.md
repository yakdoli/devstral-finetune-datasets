### 3.21.5.9 How to find the way for the disappearance of the focus rectangle if the focus is lost in the treeViewAdv

This can be done by setting `e.Active` to `false` in the `BeforeNodePaint` Event Handler.

#### [C#]

```csharp
// Set the TreeViewAdv's OwnerDrawNodes property to true.
this.treeViewAdv1.OwnerDrawNodes = true;

// Handle the TreeViewAdv's BeforeNodePaint event as shown below:
private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeNodePaint(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvPaintEventArgs e)
{
    e.Active = false;
}
```

#### [VB.NET]

```vb
' Declare the new node object.
Private NewNode As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdv = New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdv("Inserted Node")
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    Dim NewNode As TreeNodeAdv = New TreeNodeAdv()

    ' Use Insert method to add nodes at particular index.
    Me.treeViewAdv1.Nodes.Insert(2, NewNode)
End Sub
```
