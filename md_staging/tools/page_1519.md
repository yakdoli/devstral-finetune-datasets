# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The following are the splash settings available for the SplashControl.

## Automatic Launching

The properties given below describe the AutoMode features of the SplashControl.

| SplashControl Property       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AutoMode                    | Specifies if the SplashControl should automatically launch the splash screen. |
| AutoModeDisableOwner        | Specifies if the SplashControl displays modally when in AutoMode.          |
| IsShowing                   | Indicates if the splash screen is currently being displayed.               |

A splash image is displayed when an application is run, and only when the AutoMode property is set to 'True'. By default this value will be set to 'True'. When the AutoMode is set to 'False', the splash image will not be displayed when the application starts.

If the **AutoModeDisableOwner** property is set to 'True', the splash screen displays modally. The splash screen stops the user from interacting with the rest of the application until it gets hidden. Once the splash screen disappears, the user will be able to interact with the form.

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
this.SplashControl1.AutoMode = true;
this.splashControl1.AutoModeDisableOwner = true;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.SplashControl1.AutoMode = True
Me.splashControl1.AutoModeDisableOwner = True
```

The methods given below can also be used to show / hide the splash screen at run time.

| Methods       | Description                                                                                                          |
