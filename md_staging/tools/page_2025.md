### RightToLeft

Tabs framework allows the tab items in the TabControlAdv to be drawn from right to left. This can be done by setting the `RightToLeft` property to `Yes`.

This property aligns the tabs and the text from right to left, which proves to be helpful for the Right-To-Left languages.

| TabControlAdv Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RightToLeft | Specifies to draw the tabs and the text from right to left. The default value is No. |

### Rotating Tabs

The `RotateTabsWhenRTL` property can be used to rotate the tabs of the tabcontroladv that are aligned to the left and right of the tabpages. This specifies whether a tab should be drawn from left to right or from right to left. The default value is `False`.

When the `RightToLeft` mode is activated and the `RotateTabsWhenRTL` property is enabled, tab rotation is allowed.

| TabControlAdv Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RotateTabsWhenRTL | Gets / sets the value that decides whether the tabs can be rotated, when the RightToLeft mode is activated. |
