# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Demonstrates how to set the animation direction for a splash panel in a Windows Forms application.
- Explains the properties and methods for configuring the splash panel's slide style, alignment, and animation direction.

## Content

### Animation Direction: Left to Right

#### Setting the Animation Direction

The `AnimationDirection` property determines the slide animation direction of the splash panel. Here's how to configure it:

```csharp
// Set animation direction.
Me.splashPanel1.AnimationDirection = AnimationDirection.LeftToRight

// Show panel.
Me.splashPanel1.ShowSplash()
```

### 3.11.3.3.1.2.3 Right to Left

If the splash panel's `DesktopAlignment` is set to `BottomRight` or `TopRight`, support for a right-to-left slide transition can also be enabled. Here's the code to achieve it:

#### C#

```csharp
//Set panel slide style.
this.splashPanel1.SlideStyle = SlideStyle.Slide;

//Set panel location.
this.splashPanel1.DesktopAlignment = SplashAlignment.BottomRight;

//Set animation direction.
this.splashPanel1.AnimationDirection = AnimationDirection.RightToLeft;

//Show panel.
this.splashPanel1.ShowSplash();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' Set panel slide style.
Me.splashPanel1.SlideStyle = SlideStyle.Slide

' Set panel location.
Me.splashPanel1.DesktopAlignment = SplashAlignment.BottomRight

' Set animation direction.
Me.splashPanel1.AnimationDirection = AnimationDirection.RightToLeft
```
