# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The SplashPanel control can be added to the SplashControl and images can be displayed using the SplashPanel which acts as the splash screen.

The SplashPanel can also be displayed in the taskbar and an icon can be set for it using the SplashPanel settings.

## Alignment Settings

It has the ability to make the splash screen appear as a part of the screen in the desired position. DesktopAlignment property gives options to set the alignment of the splash image in the desktop.

## Image and Animation Settings

The SplashImage property needs to be set to the image to be displayed in the splash screen. The SplashControl can only display an image as the splash screen. Refer to the SplashPanel class if you want more flexibility in building a splash screen (or splash message box) that provides more control in terms of displaying information and collecting responses.

SplashScreen can be animated by enabling the ShowAnimation property.

## Host Form Settings

There are options to hide, minimize and maximize the host form when the splash image is displayed.
