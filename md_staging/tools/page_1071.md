### 3.6.4.6 GridBagLayout

#### Overview
GridBagLayout is a Layout Manager that allows users to arrange Child controls in a virtual grid of rows and columns. Unlike GridLayout, the size of the columns and rows can vary, and Child controls may span more than one cell.

#### Description
The GridBagLayout provides flexibility by allowing controls to span multiple cells and configure their positions and sizes within a grid. This layout manager is highly configurable, offering various options to lay out Child controls within the concept of a virtual grid.

#### Key Features
- **Span and Positioning**: The image demonstrates how controls can span multiple cells and be positioned at specific grid coordinates (e.g., `Pos (0, 0)`).
- **Configurability**: The GridBagLayout inherits all the functionality of the Layout Manager base class, enabling users to layout controls with great flexibility.

#### Usage Examples
The GridBagLayout is commonly used to layout the following controls:
- **Navigation Buttons of the Wizard control.**
- **Buttons of the Calculator control.**
