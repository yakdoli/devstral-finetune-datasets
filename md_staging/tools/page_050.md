## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### 3.1.1 How to change the text for already assigned banner text of a control?

This is done using the below code.

```csharp
BannerTextInfo info = 
bannerTextProvider1.GetBannerText(comboBoxAutoComplete1); // textbox is the control used for example
info.Text = "New Banner Text";
```

```vb.net
Dim info As BannerTextInfo = 
bannerTextProvider1.GetBannerText(comboBoxAutoComplete1) ' textbox is the control used for example

info.Text = "New Banner Text"
```

> Note: Make sure you clear the default value of the Text property of the controls before setting the banner text.
