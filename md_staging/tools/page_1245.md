# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Fast Updates control the Barltem states efficiently when updates are trivial, similar to MFC methods.
- Slow Updates provide a more reactive method to handle more complex state updates only when the application is idle.
- The section also addresses frequently asked questions about the control's functionality and usage.

## Content

### Fast Updates

If updating the Barltem states is a trivial operation, use the following approach, which is also how MFC does it. In this approach, the `UpdateUI` event will be called:
- When the ParentBarltem hosting this Barltem is dropped-down.
- When the Barltem is hosted in a toolbar.
- When the application goes into an idle state.
- When a shortcut corresponding to this item is about to be processed.

You can enable this behavior throughout the menu structure by setting the `BarManager.UpdateUIMFCStyle` property to `True`. For XPToolbars and ParentBaritems that are outside the scope of a BarManager, explicitly set the `UpdateUIMFCStyle` property in those instances.

#### Code Examples

**C#**
```csharp
this.mainFrameBarManager1.UpdateUIMFCStyle = true;
```

**VB.NET**
```vb.net
Me.mainFrameBarManager1.UpdateUIMFCStyle = True
```

### Slow Updates

If updating the Barltem states is not trivial, use the following approach. Turn on the `UpdateUIOnAppIdle` property of the Barltem whose state has changed, and the framework will initiate its `UpdateUI` event the next time the application goes into an idle state.

#### Code Examples

**C#**
```csharp
this.barItem1.UpdateUIOnAppIdle = true;
```

**VB.NET**
```vb.net
Me.barItem1.UpdateUIOnAppIdle = True
```

### Additional Notes

The document explains how to manage UI updates efficiently for bar items in a Windows Forms application, accommodating both simple and complex state changes. It also includes practical code examples for implementing these approaches in both C# and VB.NET, as well as a section addressing common queries.
