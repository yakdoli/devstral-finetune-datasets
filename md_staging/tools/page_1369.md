### 3.9.1.6.5 How to save and restore the State information of a Stacked Mode GroupBar

The `AppStateSerializer` can be utilized to manage the state of GroupBar items in a Stacked Mode GroupBar. This is achieved by employing the `SerializeObject` and `DeserializeObject` methods.

### 3.9.1.6.6 How to give the space between text and icon in the GroupBarItem

The `Padding` property of GroupBarItem is responsible for providing spacing between icons and text.

#### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
this.groupBarItem1.Padding = 10;
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]
Me.groupBarItem1.Padding = 10
```

### 3.9.1.6.7 How do I paint the GroupBarItem image without scaling the image?

To render the image of a GroupBarItem without scaling it, you can override the `DrawGroupBarItemImage` method of the GroupBar. This allows for precise control over the image's appearance.

#### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
// For this callback to occur, LargeImageMode must be set to true.
this.groupBarItem1.LargeImageMode = true;

protected override void DrawGroupBarItemImage(Graphics gph, int nindex, Rectangle rch)
{
    Point location = new Point(rch.X + 20, rch.Y);
    gph.DrawImage(this.VisibleGroupBarItems[nindex].Image, new Rectangle(location, new Size(20, 20)));
}
```
