### VB.NET

The user could use the Left Image of a node as a clickable area to use it as a button associated with that particular tree node.

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_MouseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles treeViewAdv1.MouseUp
    Dim node As TreeNodeAdv = Me.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode
    Dim imgpt As Point = New Point(node.TextAndImageBounds.X, node.TextAndImageBounds.Y)
    Dim imgSize As Size = New Size(Me.imageList1.ImageSize.Width, Me.imageList1.ImageSize.Height)
    Dim imgrec As Rectangle = New Rectangle(imgpt, imgSize)
    Dim clickpt As Point = New Point(e.X, e.Y)
    If imgrec.Contains(clickpt) = True Then
        Console.WriteLine("Clicked on " & node.Text & "'s left image")
    End If
End Sub
```

The user could use the Right Image of a node as a clickable area to use it as a button associated with that particular tree node.

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_MouseUp(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles treeViewAdv1.MouseUp
    Dim node As TreeNodeAdv = Me.treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode
    Dim imgpt As Point = New Point(node.RightImagesX, node.TextBounds.Y)
    Dim imgSize As Size = New Size(Me.imageList1.ImageSize.Width, Me.imageList1.ImageSize.Height)
    Dim imgrec As Rectangle = New Rectangle(imgpt, imgSize)
    Dim clickpt As Point = New Point(e.X, e.Y)
    If imgrec.Contains(clickpt) = True Then
        MessageBox.Show("Clicked on " & node.Text & "'s right image")
        Console.WriteLine("Clicked on " & node.Text & "'s right image")
    End If
End Sub
```
