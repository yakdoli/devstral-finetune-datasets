# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Use the Delete key for deleting nodes and as a shortcut for BarItems/Menultems in TreeViewAdv.
- Handle LabelEdit nodes, bar items, and menu items to manage shortcuts and avoid conflicts.

## How to Use Delete Key for Deleting and as a Shortcut to BarItems / Menuitems of TreeViewAdv

The form contains a treeViewAdv with nodes having the LabelEdit property set to true, along with BarItems or MenuItems that have the Delete key as their shortcut. After entering edit mode by pressing F2, if the Delete key is pressed, unwanted behavior can occur. To avoid triggering the menu shortcut and instead trigger the deletion of text in the editor, follow the procedure outlined below.

### Procedure
Disable the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gains focus, and re-enable it once the editor loses focus. This can be achieved by handling the TreeViewAdv's BeforeEdit event, setting the bar item's shortcut to `None` and listening to the node's edit textbox's Leave event. Within the Leave event handler, reset the bar item's shortcut back to `Del`.

#### C#
```csharp
TextBox editbox;

private void treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(object sender,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs e)
{
    this.editbox = e.TextBox;
    this.editbox.Leave += new EventHandler(editbox_Leave);
    // Disabling the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gets focused.
    this.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.None;
}

// Enabling the shortcut as soon as the editor loses focus.
private void editbox_Leave(object sender, EventArgs args)
{
    this.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.Del;
}
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
Private editbox As TextBox
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_BeforeEdit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.TreeNodeAdvBeforeEditEventArgs)
    Me.editbox = e.TextBox
    AddHandler editbox.Leave, AddressOf editbox_Leave
    ' Disabling the menu shortcut as soon as the editor gets focused.
    Me.barItem1.Shortcut = Shortcut.None
End Sub
Private Sub editbox_Leave(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As EventArgs)
End Sub
```
