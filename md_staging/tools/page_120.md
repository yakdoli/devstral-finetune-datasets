## Content
### Docking Window
Docking window wraps the host control that is docked and enables the control to be dragged to the required position.

### Dock Arrows
Dock arrow guides where the control is to be docked and docks the control in the specified side.

### WYSIWYG Designer Engine
To ease the process of designing layouts, the docking windows framework provides a very powerful WYSIWYG designer that allows you to design your application's docking layout merely by dragging and re-docking or floating the controls at the desired docking state during the design process. The layout is automatically serialized by the designer and can be restored during application start up or at any other time.

### Tabbed Docking
Docking manager allows controls to be tabbed along with the docking capability.

### Auto Hide
Docking manager provides an auto hide facility to the docked control. Docked controls can be hidden and will be tabbed along the side of the container control on which it was placed. The control will restore its appearance when the tab is clicked.

### Toggle Docking
The docked control can toggle its docking capability to floating and vice versa by double-clicking on the caption or the title bar of the docking window. See Floating topic.
