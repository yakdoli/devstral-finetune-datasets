## Essential Tools for Windows Forms

### DragProviderStyle

#### Figure 90: Whidbey DragProviderStyle

**Description:**  
This image illustrates the Whidbey DragProviderStyle feature in a Windows Forms application. The screenshot shows a form with a control named `listBox2`, which is surrounded by a set of Dock arrows. These arrows indicate the possible docking positions available for the control. The mouse pointer is hovering over the top Dock arrow, highlighting the target area for docking the control at the top of the form.

#### Figure 91: VS 2008 DragProviderStyle

**Description:**  
This image demonstrates the VS 2008 DragProviderStyle functionality. Similar to the Whidbey example, it shows a form with a control named `listBox`, also surrounded by Dock arrows. The user can drag the control to the top of the form, and a shadow appears, indicating the target docking area. The alignment of the shadow and the highlighted area at the top of the Dock arrows confirm the docking action.

### Overview

This section introduces the DragProviderStyle feature in both Whidbey (an older version) and VS 2008, highlighting how it allows users to intuitively dock controls within a Windows Forms application. The shadow effect and target highlighting play a crucial role in providing visual feedback during the docking process.
