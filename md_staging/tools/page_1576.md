## Event Data

The event handler receives an argument of type `CancelEventArgs` containing data related to this event. The following `CancelEventArgs` member provides information specific to this event.

| Member  | Description                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Cancel  | Indicates whether the event should be canceled.       |

You can handle this event by including the below code.

### C#

```csharp
// Handle the SplashClosing event.
this.splashPanel1.SplashClosing += new
CancelEventHandler(splashPanel1_SplashClosing);

private void splashPanel1_SplashClosing(object sender,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashClosedEventArgs args)
{
    string eventlogmessage = String.Format("Event: {0} Object: {1}\r\n",
    "SplashClosing", ((Control)sender).Name);
    if (this.InvokeRequired)
    {
        this.Invoke(new SetStringDelegate(OutputText), new object[] {
            eventlogmessage });
    }
    else
    {
        OutputText(eventlogmessage);
    }
    if (this.Controls.Contains(this.splashPanel1) == false)
        this.Controls.Add(this.splashPanel1);
    this.splashPanel1.Location = this.currentPt1;
    this.splashPanel1.Visible = true;
}
```

' Handle the SplashClosing event.
AddHandler Me.splashPanel1.SplashClosing, AddressOf
splashPanel1_SplashClosing
