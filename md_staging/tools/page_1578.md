# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes event handling for the `SplashClosedEvent` in a Windows Forms application.
- Demonstrates how to log and handle the `SplashClosing` event using both C# and VB.NET.
- Includes steps for adding and positioning a `SplashPanel` control.

### Handling the SplashClosed Event
This section illustrates how to handle the `SplashClosed` event in both C# and VB.NET, providing examples for logging the event and managing the splash panel control.

#### C# Example
```csharp
SplashClosedEventHandler(splashPanel1_SplashClosed);

private void splashPanel1_SplashClosed(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashClosedEventArgs args)
{
    string eventlogmessage = String.Format("Event: {0} Object: {1}\r\n", "SplashClosing", ((Control)sender).Name);
    if (this.InvokeRequired)
    {
        this.Invoke(new SetStringDelegate(OutputText), new object[] { eventlogmessage });
    }
    else
    {
        OutputText(eventlogmessage);
    }
    if (this.Controls.Contains(this.splashPanel1) == false)
        this.Controls.Add(this.splashPanel1);
    this.splashPanel1.Location = this.currentPt1;
    this.splashPanel1.Visible = true;

    // Returns the SplashCloseType value indicating the way in which the splash was closed.
    args.SplashCloseType.ToString();
}
```

#### VB.NET Example
```vb
' Handle the SplashClosed event.
AddHandler Me.splashPanel1.SplashClosed, AddressOf splashPanel1_SplashClosed

Private Sub splashPanel1_SplashClosed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashClosedEventArgs) Handles splashPanel1.SplashClosed
    Dim eventlogmessage As String = String.Format("Event: {0} Object: {1}" & Constants.vbCrLf, "SplashClosing", (CType(sender, Control)).Name)
    If Me.InvokeRequired Then
        Me.Invoke(New SetStringDelegate(AddressOf OutputText), New Object() { eventlogmessage })
    Else
        OutputText(eventlogmessage)
    End If
    If Me.Controls.Contains(Me.splashPanel1) = False Then
        Me.Controls.Add(Me.splashPanel1)
    End If
End Sub
```

### Key Points
1. **Event Handling**: The `SplashClosed` event is handled to manage the behavior of a `SplashPanel` when it is closed.
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Both C# and VB.NET examples are provided for versatility.
3. **Logging**: Event logs are generated to track the closure of the splash screen, ensuring transparency in application behavior.
4. **Control Management**: The `SplashPanel` is added to the controls collection and positioned dynamically, ensuring it functions correctly during runtime.

## API Reference

### SplashPanel Methods and Events
- **`SplashClosedEvent`**: Raised when the splash panel is closed.
- **`Controls.Contains`**: Checks if a control is already added to the `Controls` collection.
- **`Controls.Add`**: Adds a control to the `Controls` collection of a container.

## Code Examples

### C# Example: Handling `SplashClosed`
```csharp
// Attach the event handler.
SplashClosedEventHandler(splashPanel1_SplashClosed);

// Define the event handler.
private void splashPanel1_SplashClosed(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashClosedEventArgs args)
{
    // ... (see full example above)
}
```

### VB.NET Example: Handling `SplashClosed`
```vb
' Attach the event handler.
AddHandler Me.splashPanel1.SplashClosed, AddressOf splashPanel1_SplashClosed

' Define the event handler.
Private Sub splashPanel1_SplashClosed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal args As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.SplashClosedEventArgs) Handles splashPanel1.SplashClosed
    ' ... (see full example above)
End Sub
```
