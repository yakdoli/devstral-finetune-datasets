{
    // This prints the distance in pixels, the mouse pointer has been moved
    // horizontally in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Distance Horizontally : " + e.DX.ToString());

    // This prints the distance in pixels, the mouse pointer has been moved
    // vertically in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("distance Vertically : " + e.DY.ToString());

    // This when set to true indicates that you have scrolled and do not want the default scrolling behavior
    e.Scrolled = true;

    // The below code cancels the event
    e.Cancel = true;

    ' This prints the distance in pixels, the mouse pointer has been moved
    ' horizontally in the output window at run time.
    Console.Write("Distance Horizontally : " & e.DX.ToString())

    ' This prints the distance in pixels, the mouse pointer has been moved
    ' vertically in the output window at run time.
