![](Figure 817: BarItem Collection Editor)

#### Note:
With such a custom ParentBarItem associated with the pop-up menu, you cannot add items using drag-and-drop from the BarManager.

#### In the Presence of the BarManager
You can also reuse the ParentBarItem that you have already created for your menu structure using BarManager to fill the Pop-up menu. To do so, set the `ParentBarItem` property of the Pop-up menu to one of the available ParentBarItems.
