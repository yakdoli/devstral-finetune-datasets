# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the control and display of tooltips for bar items using the `BarManager` property.
- Explains the use of `BarItemActiveFormCheckOverride` to manage tooltip visibility.
- Introduces two types of `BarManagers`: `MainFrameBarManager` and `ChildFrameBarManager`.
- Outlines the association of `BarManagers` in MDI scenarios and their design-time support.

### Displaying Tooltips for Bar Items

**Note:** We can control the display of tooltips for the bar items, only when the form is active, using the below `BarManager` property.

| **BarManager Property**                   | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BarItemActiveFormCheckOverride`          | Specifies whether bar items should check for active form before displaying the tooltips. |

#### Code Examples

[C#]

```csharp
this.mainFrameBarManager1.BarItemActiveFormCheckOverride = true;
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Me.mainFrameBarManager1.BarItemActiveFormCheckOverride = True
```

### 3.7.4.1.3 BarManagers

There are two kinds of `BarManagers`.

- `MainFrameBarManager`
- `ChildFrameBarManager`

The `MainFrameBarManager` is associated with a MDI container form in the MDI scenario or with the top-level form in a single document scenario.

The `ChildFrameBarManager` should be associated with a `MDIChild` in the MDI scenario.

These two classes are derived from the `BarManager` and hence will be referred to as such when discussing features common to both these classes.

**Note:** At run-time, a `ChildFrameBarManager` does not show the menus and toolbars inside a child form. It is merely a placeholder for the menus and toolbars during design-time, which will be merged into the main form's menus during run-time.

### BarManager Features

BarManagers come with full design-time support and lets users add menus and toolbars and fill them with items, all without writing a single line of code. The **Customize dialog** facilitates customization of the menus. It is available to the developer during design-time and to the end user during runtime.
