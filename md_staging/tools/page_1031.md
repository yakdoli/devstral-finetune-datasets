#### 3.6.4.3 CardLayout

##### Overview of CardLayout

A CardLayout is a Layout Manager applied to a Container, where components are added to the layout in a predefined form and not between different forms. Each component in the Container is treated as a card. Only one card is visible at a time, and the Container acts as a stack of cards. The first component added to a CardLayout object is the visible component when the Container is first displayed.

##### Characteristics of CardLayout

The Child component / card can either be made to fill or simply centered within the Container. Common uses of a CardLayout include creating WizardControls and property pages.

**Note:** The WizardControl uses the CardLayout component internally in its implementation.
