### 3.22.1.4.2 Wizard Page Settings

#### Overview
- A Wizard Page includes a collection of controls to implement an interactive Wizard interface.
- Wizard pages are added to the Wizard Container, allowing you to add any control into a wizard page.
- Wizard Control lets you customize individual Wizard pages to give each page a unique functionality.

#### Creating a Basic Wizard
The "Creating a Basic Wizard" topic discussed how to add Wizard Pages. Let us see how to customize the Wizard pages.

#### Setting Title and Description

You can specify the title and description in the Banner Panel, for a particular Wizard Page using the **WizardPage.Title** and **WizardPage.Description** properties. The appearance of the title and description can be controlled through Label properties. See **Title and Description Settings** for details.

| **Property**    | **Description**             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Title           | Specifies the title of the page. |
| Description     | Specifies the description for the page. |

##### Code Example: Setting Title and Description
```csharp
this.wizardControlPage1.Title = "Registration Details";
this.wizardControlPage1.Description = "Please enter your Details:";
```

#### Note
- A WizardControl can have only one page title label and one page description label.
- You can change only the text of these two labels for individual pages using **WizardPage.Title** and **WizardPage.Description** properties and not their appearance. Hence Font and ForeColor settings will be similar in all the page.

#### Appearance and Styling
- While the text of the title and description labels can be customized, their appearance (FontStyle, ForeColor) cannot be changed individually for each Wizard Page as they apply uniformly across the Wizard control.
