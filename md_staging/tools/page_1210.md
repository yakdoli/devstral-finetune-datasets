# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes how to merge toolbars and menus of child forms with the Main form using the RegisterMDIChildType function.
- Explains the XP Menus framework's support for associating menus and toolbars for MDI Child forms.
- Demonstrates MDI merging and provides sample code in C# and VB.NET.

6. Now merge the toolbars and menus of the child form with the Main form using the RegisterMDIChildType function as follows.

#### Code Examples
**C#**
```csharp
this.MainFrameBarManager1.RegisterMdiChildTypes(new Type[] { typeof(TextEditorForm) });
```

**VB.NET**
```vb
Me.MainFrameBarManager1.RegisterMdiChildTypes(New Type() { GetType(TextEditorForm) })
```

A sample demonstrating the MDI feature is available in the below sample installation location.

### MDI Merging

The XP Menus framework goes to a great extent to support associating menus and toolbars for MDI Child forms. It helps users to create custom menu items and toolbars for child forms and handle menu events right within the child form. Without this support, users would have to handle menu click events in their main form and delegate it to the appropriate child forms with drawn-out casting and run-time checks and would also have to manually control menu and toolbar visibility based on the active MDIChild forms.

Once an MDIChild form is associated with a ChildFrameBarManager, the XP Menus framework merges the menus and toolbars of the child form with that of the main form. There are two ways in which MDI merging can happen.

### Types of MDI Merging

- **Auto Merging**
  The framework will automatically merge the menus of the child forms with that of the main form when a new instance of the child type is parented by the MDIParent. This merging will be undone when all instances of that child type are closed. This is the default behavior.

- **Explicit Merging**
  Explicitly merging the child types when the application loads will provide a completely merged menu/toolbar structure to the end users, all the time. This merged state will stay.
