### MouseEventHandler and MouseEventArgs

The MouseEventHandler receives an argument of type MouseEventArgs containing data related to this event. The following MouseEventArgs members provide information specific to this event.

| Members | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Button | Gets which mouse button was pressed. |
| Clicks | Gets the number of times the mouse button was pressed and released. |
| Delta | Gets a signed count of the number of detents the mouse wheel has rotated. A detent is one notch of the mouse wheel. |
| Location | Gets the location of the mouse when during generating mouse events. |
| X | Gets the X-coordinate of the mouse when during generating mouse events. |
| Y | Gets the Y-coordinate of the mouse during generating mouse events. |

### Hide Context Menu When User Clicks on an Empty Space on the TreeViewAdv

If the user clicks on an empty space on the TreeViewAdv, the appearance of the context menu can be avoided by handling MouseDown and MouseUp event handlers. With the help of this, the user will be able to know which node is being edited currently. Here the Selected node is set to RMousedownNode. The RMousedownNode gets / sets the node on which, the user had done a Right-MouseDown.

#### Code Example

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // Suspends the painting of the control.
    if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Right)
    {
        this.treeViewAdv1.BeginUpdate();
        if (this.treeViewAdv1.RMouseDownNode != null)
    }
}
```
