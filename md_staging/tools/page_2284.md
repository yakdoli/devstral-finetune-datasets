### Mouse Hover Event in TreeViewAdv

#### [VB.NET]

```vb
Private Sub treeViewAdv1_MouseHover(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim ptInTree As Point = Me.treeViewAdv1.PointToClient(New Point(MousePosition.X, MousePosition.Y))
    ' Get the node at the point where mouse pointer is located
    Dim node As TreeNodeAdv = Me.treeViewAdv1.GetNodeAtPoint(ptInTree)
    If node.TextBounds.Contains(treeViewAdv1.PointToClient(Control.MousePosition)) Then
        Me.toolTip1.SetToolTip(Me.treeViewAdv1, node.Text)
    Else
        Me.toolTip1.SetToolTip(Me.treeViewAdv1, "")

### How to fire click event, when a child node is selected

#### 3.21.5.3 **How to fire click event, when a child node is selected**

Whenever a `TreeViewAdv` is selected, the `AfterSelect` event will be raised. You can raise a `Click` event when a child node is selected, inside this handler using the following code snippet.

#### [C#]

```csharp
private void treeViewAdv1_AfterSelect(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // iterate through parent nodes in the collection
    foreach (TreeNodeAdv node in this.treeViewAdv1.Nodes)
    {
        if (node.IsSelected)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(node.Text + " is selected");
        }
        CheckForChildren(node);
    }
}

private void CheckForChildren(TreeNodeAdv node)
{
    // Code to check for child nodes and raise click event
}
```

## API Reference (if applicable)
