# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates essential tools for managing state persistence in Windows Forms applications.
- Focuses on using various storage techniques to save and restore the state of CommandBars.

## Content

### State Management Techniques
The provided code examples in VB.NET illustrate handling different storage techniques for saving and restoring the state of CommandBars in Windows Forms applications. Each `CheckedChanged` event for different radio buttons triggers the assignment of a storage technique to a shared variable `selRad`.

```vb
[VB.NET]

Private Sub radXML_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "XML"
End Sub

Private Sub radBinary_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "Binary Format"
End Sub

Private Sub radIsoS_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "Isolated Storage"
End Sub

Private Sub radBinFmt_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "Binary Fmt Format"
End Sub

Private Sub radReg_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "Windows Registry"
End Sub

Private Sub radXMLFmt_CheckedChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    selRad = "XML Fmt Format"
End Sub
```

### Instructions for Demonstration
- **Run the sample:** Start the Windows Forms application.
- **Dock the CommandBars:** Move the CommandBars to any desired location within the application.
- **Save the state:** Use any of the storage techniques to save the position and layout of the CommandBars.
- **Close the application:** Exit the application, ensuring the saved state is preserved.

### Saved State Demonstration
The next screen shot illustrates the saved layout of the CommandBar object after the application has been closed and subsequently reopened. The state is restored using the selected storage technique, demonstrating seamless state management.
