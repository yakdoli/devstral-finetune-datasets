# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The following VB.NET code snippet illustrates how to implement a progress bar using a timer in Windows Forms:

```vb
' Declare and initialize count.
Dim count As Integer = 0

' Set the code for the timer_Tick event.
Private Sub timer1_Tick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    If Me.progressBarAdv1.Value < 100 Then
        Me.progressBarAdv1.Value += 10
    Else
        Me.progressBarAdv1.Value = 0
    End If
End Sub

' Set the code for the button_Click event.
Private Sub button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)
    count += 1
    If count Mod 2 = 1 Then
        Me.timer1.Start()
    ElseIf count Mod 2 = 0 Then
        Me.timer1.[Stop]()
    End If
End Sub

' Handle the ValueChanged event.
AddHandler Me.progressBarAdv1.ValueChanged, AddressOf progressBarAdv1_ValueChanged

' Define the ValueChanged event.
Private Sub progressBarAdv1_ValueChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools.ProgressBarValueChangedEventArgs)
    e.Text = "Value Changing...." + Me.progressBarAdv1.Value.ToString()
    e.Handled = True
End Sub
```
