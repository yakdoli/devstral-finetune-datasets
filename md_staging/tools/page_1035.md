# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Configuring Child Controls

- **Deriving from the Layout Manager base, the CardLayout inherits all the functionality that the Layout Manager type exposes.**

### Overview
- CardLayout allows the creation of a multi-card interface where each card can contain various controls.
- Panels act as individual cards, allowing the addition of controls to each card.
- During runtime, only one card is visible at a time, and navigation between cards can be achieved using buttons or other controls.

### Detailed Description
For example:
- When the CardLayout is added to a form, a Panel control can be added to it, where this Panel acts as Card1. Users can then add the needed controls to this Panel.
- Additional Panels can be added to act as Card2, Card3, etc.
- At runtime, only one Card will be visible at a time.
- Navigation between Cards can be managed by adding buttons and setting the appropriate code.

### Example Layout
- In the following screenshot, the Panel control acts as the Container control, and the Label control acts as a card.
