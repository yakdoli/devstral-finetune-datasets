# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

The Editors Package provides several controls that can be used in displaying, collecting and validating user input. The different controls that are included in the Editors Package have been listed and discussed below:

## AutoAppend

It provides auto persisting of previously entered items in a Windows Forms combo box based on a category keyword and also populates the combo box control's items collection with the persisted list.
