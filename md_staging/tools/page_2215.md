# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- TreeViewAdv architecture improves visual appeal through effective use of gutter space and indentation features.
- Control spacing and hierarchy management are crucial for a clean and organized layout.

## Content

### GutterSpace

The space on the left side of a TreeViewAdv control is referred to as the gutter space, which acts as a left margin. It can be customized using the `GutterSpace` property. By default, it is set to 3.

#### Example Code: Adjusting GutterSpace

- **C#**
```csharp
this.treeViewAdv1.GutterSpace = 7;
```

- **VB.NET**
```vb
Me.treeViewAdv1.GutterSpace = 5
```

### Indentation

The space that exists between a parent node and its child node is known as indentation. It defines how child nodes are indented relative to their parent nodes. The `Indent` property of the TreeViewAdv control can be used to adjust the indentation. The default value for indentation is 19.

#### Example Code: Modifying Indentation

- **C#**
```csharp
this.treeViewAdv1.Indent = 21
```

- **VB.NET**
```vb
Me.treeViewAdv1.Indent = 21
```
