# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview

- This page explains the usage of `CellSpanX` and `CellSpanY` properties to control the spanning behavior of child controls in a GridBagLayout.
- It discusses how to configure the `CellSpanX` and `CellSpanY` properties to make controls span multiple rows and/or columns.
- The concept of `Anchor` property is introduced to anchor controls at the sides or corners of their allocated layout area.

## Content

### Note: The GetLayoutWeights() method returns the row and column weights of the current layout.

### CellSpanX and CellSpanY

The Child controls by default span a single cell with these properties set to `(1, 1)`. However, it can be made to span multiple rows and/or columns by changing these properties.

| Child Control Constraints | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CellSpanX**             | Specifies the number of columns this component should span in the virtual grid. The default value is set to 'Null'. |
| **CellSpanY**             | Specifies the number of rows this component should span in the virtual grid. The default value is set to 'Null'.   |

The below screenshot shows button1 spanning 2 columns (`CellSpanX = 2` and `Fill = Horizontal`). This also results in button1 overlapping button3, which also occupies the `(1, 0)` cell.

### Anchor

Once a Child control has been allocated the layout area (usually one or more cells) in the virtual grid, it may be anchored at the sides or the corners of that layout area. This can be done using the property given below.

| Child Control Constraint | Description                                                                      |
