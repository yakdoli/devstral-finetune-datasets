## TreeNode Features

### Overview

This section provides an in-depth look at various features of tree nodes in a tree view control, particularly focusing on customizations and functionalities available for enhancing the user interface.

#### Key Features Discussed
- **Primitives**: Explains different primitives used for tree nodes.
- **Node Images**: Outlines methods to set images for different states of a node, including left, right, and state images. Additionally, it discusses the concept of overlaying images on existing ones.
- **MultiLine Support**: Details the multiline text option for tree nodes.

### Details on TreeNode Features

#### Primitives
The primitives section discusses various primitives available for tree nodes, enhancing their visual and functional attributes.

#### Node Images
This section elaborates on how to set images for different aspects of a node, including:
- **Left, Right, and State Images**
- **Expand and Collapse Image**
- **Line Images**
- **Image Overlaying**: Specifically notes that this feature is applicable only for the first column or the tree structure.
- **Plus Sign On ExpandMode**: Enhances branch nodes with a plus sign when in expand mode.

#### Notable Note
> **Note:** The below properties can be applied only to the first column among the multiple columns.

#### Additional Node Features
- **Checkbox and Option Buttons**: Illustrates the setting of checkbox and option buttons for tree nodes.
- **Multiline Support**: Discusses multiline support for nodes.
- **Custom Controls**: Illustrates adding custom controls to nodes within the control.

### Multiline Support

#### Subsection Description
The node text can be displayed on multiple lines by using the `Multiline` property of TreeNodeAdv. This property allows each node to have multiline text, offering flexibility in text display.

#### Implementation Steps
To enable multiline support:
1. **Set the Multiline Property**: This can be done through the NodeCollection Editor.
2. **Adjust Node Height**: Modify the default Node height value to accommodate the multiline text effectively.

#### Property Description Table

| **TreeNodeAdv Property** | **Description** |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Multiline                | Specifies if the node text is drawn as multiple text or single line. |

#### Code Example
The node text should be provided through code, as shown in the following code snippet. (Code snippet is not provided here due to the OCR limitations.)

### Summary

This section provides a detailed exploration of TreeNode features in a tree view control, covering various aspects such as primitives, node images, and multiline text options. These features are essential for customizing the appearance and functionality of the tree nodes to meet specific application requirements.
