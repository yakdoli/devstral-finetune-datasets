#### WeightX and WeightY

The next setting determines the weights for each row and column. The GridBagLayout determines the width and height of the rows based on the preferred size setting of the Child components. Then it allocates the extra horizontal and vertical space available between these columns and rows based on their weights. The weight of a row or column is basically the largest weight of all the Child components in that row or column.

| Child Control Constraints | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WeightX                   | Specifies the weight of this component in containing the extra horizontal space. The default value is set to 'Null'. |
| WeightY                   | Specifies the weight of this component in containing the extra vertical space. The default value is set to 'Null'.  |

By default, the weights are set to 'Null', in which case, the available space is not distributed to the rows and columns at all. The virtual grid will simply be centered to the Container's client area, as shown below.
