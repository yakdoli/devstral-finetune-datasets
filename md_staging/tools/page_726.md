### 3.5.8.2.5 Frequently Asked Questions

#### 3.5.8.2.5.1 How to add new items to the List when enter key is pressed

To add the new items which are entered by the user at runtime after the user had pressed the enter key, we need to catch the `KeyDown` event.

##### C#

```csharp
private void domainUpDownExt1_KeyDown(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs e)
{
    // Add new items when user press the Enter key.
    if (e.KeyCode == Keys.Enter)
    {
        if (!domainUpDownExt1.Items.Contains(domainUpDownExt1.Text))
        {
            domainUpDownExt1.Items.Add(domainUpDownExt1.Text);
        }
    }
}
```

##### VB.NET

```vb
Private Sub domainUpDownExt1_KeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs)
    ' Add new items when user press the Enter key.
    If e.KeyCode = Keys.Enter Then
        If Not domainUpDownExt1.Items.Contains(domainUpDownExt1.Text) Then
            domainUpDownExt1.Items.Add(domainUpDownExt1.Text)
        End If
    End If
End Sub
```
