# Essential Tools for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Explains how to improve the performance of nodes in a `TreeViewAdv` control by utilizing properties and methods for redrawing and recalculating dimensions.
- Describes the `SuspendExpandRecalculate` and `RecalculateExpansion` properties, along with the `BeginUpdate` and `EndUpdate` methods to optimize node addition times.

### Properties and Their Effects

| Property                       | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SuspendExpandRecalculate       | The population time for a node is reduced significantly. For example, the time taken to populate a node is halved from 10 ms to 5 ms when this property is set to `true`. This optimization also reduces unnecessary recalculations for child nodes when root nodes are collapsed. |
| RecalculateExpansion           | Indicates whether node dimension calculations should occur on load. By default, this property is `true`. Setting it to `false` improves node performance on load by avoiding unnecessary recalculations. |

### TreeViewAdv Methods

| TreeViewAdv Methods | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BeginUpdate         | Calling this method stops the redrawing of the control, resulting in faster node addition compared to normal operations.                                     |
| EndUpdate           | Resumes the painting of the control after it has been suspended by the `BeginUpdate` method.                                                             |

### Note on Performance Optimization

> **Note:** While adding more than one node to the `treeViewAdv` control, calling the `BeginUpdate` and `EndUpdate` methods will improve the performance of the control.

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
this.treeViewAdv1.SuspendExpandRecalculate = true;

this.treeViewAdv1.BeginUpdate();
// add more number of nodes
' ...
this.treeViewAdv1.EndUpdate();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.treeViewAdv1.SuspendExpandRecalculate = True

Me.treeViewAdv1.BeginUpdate()
' add more number of nodes
' ...
```
