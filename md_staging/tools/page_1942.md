### 3.14.2.8 Setting Tick Frequency

The ticks can be placed at required intervals by setting the `TickFrequency` property to the required number. For example, if the range is set from 0-100, where minimum is set to 0 and maximum is set to 100, and the `TickFrequency` is set to 20, then Ticks will be placed at positions \(0, 20, 40, \ldots, 100\).

The following example illustrates the same.

```csharp
rangeSlider.TickFrequency = 3;
```

### 3.14.2.9 Setting Orientation

The layout of the range slider can be defined using the `Orientation` property. The orientation of the control can either be vertical or horizontal.

- **When Orientation is set to Horizontal.**

```csharp
rangeSlider.Orientation = Orientation.Horizontal;
```
