This event occurs before a node is selected. This event is illustrated in the “How to prevent a node from being selected?” topic.

### 3.21.4.8.2 HotTracking Events in TreeViewAdv

#### Description

In TreeViewAdv, a NodeHotTrackChanged event enables users to retrieve the TreeViewAdv node which is currently being hot tracked by the mouse. This event will be triggered when the mouse moves over the nodes in a tree view, and the node that is currently selected by the mouse pointer is the hot tracked node.

#### Use Cases:

If a user needs to get a particular node's details as it is being tracked by the mouse pointer, this event will provide this information through its event arguments.
