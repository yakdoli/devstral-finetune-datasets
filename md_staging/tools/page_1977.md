## Overivew

- TabPages are components of the `TabControl` that allow multiple sections of content to be displayed in a single interface.
- Each `TabPage` acts as a container for child controls and can be added dynamically.
- This guide explains how to create `TabControlAdv` both through the designer and programmatically.

## Content

### TabPages

TabPages are the pages included in the `TabControl`. The TabPages are laid one above the other, and only a single tab page can be viewed at a time. Each page acts as a `ContainerControl` and can host `ChildControls` within it using the `TabPageAdv` panel-derived class.

The `TabPageAdv` can be added to the `TabControlAdv` through the designer as well as through code.
