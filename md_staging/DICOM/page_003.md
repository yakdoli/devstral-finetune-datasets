# Essential DICOM

## 1 Overview

### 1.1 Introduction to DICOM

The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard was created by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). Its aim is to support the distribution and viewing of medical images from CT, MRI, and other medical modalities. The DICOM format is an extension of the older NEMA standard.

A DICOM file contains a header and the image data. The header stores information about the patient's name, the type of scan, position and dimension of the image, and lots of other data. The image data part contains all the image information. DICOM is the common standard for scans in hospitals.

### 1.2 Use Case Scenario

This feature helps users to convert the standard image formats to the DICOM format for medical communications. It is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging.
