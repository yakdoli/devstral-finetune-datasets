# Essential ProjIO

## 5 How To

### 5.1 Does ProjIO require MS Project to be installed on the machine?

No. ProjIO is a 100% Native .Net Library that does not depend on MS Project.

### 5.2 Will it be possible to view the generated project [`.xml` file] using ProjIO?

No. ProjIO does not have a Graphical User Interface to view the generated project files. MS Project is required to view the project files generated by using ProjIO.

### 5.3 Can Essential ProjIO be used to read MS Project files?

Essential ProjIO provides support for reading MS Project XML format files. Currently ProjIO does not support reading and writing files in `.mpp` or `.mpt` format.

### 5.4 How to retrieve tasks from a project?

The tasks present in a project can be retrieved using the `GetTaskByUID` method.  
The following code snippet illustrates retrieving tasks using this method:

```csharp
// Opening the project file
Project project = ProjectReader.Open(@"D:\ProjectWithTasks.xml");

// Retrieving a task by UID
Task task = project.GetTaskByUID(2);

// Viewing retrieved task information
Console.WriteLine("Task Name: " + task.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Task Start Date: " + task.Start);
Console.WriteLine("Task Finish Date: " + task.Finish);
Console.WriteLine("No. of Sub Tasks: " + task.Children.Count);
```

## API Reference

### Overview
- ProjIO allows retrieving tasks from a project by UID.
- The `ProjectReader` class is used to open the project file.
- Task details such as name, start date, finish date, and sub-task count can be accessed.

### Methods
- `GetTaskByUID(int uid)`
  - Retrieves a task from the project based on its unique identifier (UID).
  - **Parameters:**
    - `uid`: The unique identifier of the task to retrieve.
  - **Returns:**
    - `Task`: The task object corresponding to the provided UID.
  - **Example Usage:**
    ```csharp
    Task task = project.GetTaskByUID(2);
    ```

### Task Properties
- `Name`
  - The name of the task.
- `Start`
  - The start date of the task.
- `Finish`
  - The finish date of the task.
- `Children`
  - A collection of sub-tasks under the specified task.
    - `Count`: The number of sub-tasks.

## Code Examples

### Retrieving a Task by UID

```csharp
using System;
using Syncfusion.ProjectIO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Open the project file
        Project project = ProjectReader.Open(@"D:\ProjectWithTasks.xml");

        // Retrieve a task by UID
        Task task = project.GetTaskByUID(2);

        // Display task details
        Console.WriteLine("Task Name: " + task.Name);
        Console.WriteLine("Task Start Date: " + task.Start);
        Console.WriteLine("Task Finish Date: " + task.Finish);
        Console.WriteLine("No. of Sub Tasks: " + task.Children.Count);
    }
}
```
