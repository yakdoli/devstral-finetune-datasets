# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## 4.3.4.5.1 Appearance Options

The simplest way to check exactly which cells are affected by setting one of these properties is to use the Preview and Edit verb to display a Grid Grouping control and then set the property to view the effect.

When using the Preview tool at design-time, there is a cell tip that is displayed over each cell which, gives information regarding that cell. In particular, the first line of the tip will give the exact **Appearance** property that this cell is based on. In addition, it will also list the Appearance properties that the cell inherits. Here is a graphic showing some cell tip samples.
