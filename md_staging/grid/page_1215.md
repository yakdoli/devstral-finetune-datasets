# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
this.gridControl1[0,3].CellType = "Static";
this.gridControl1[0,3].CellAppearance = GridCellAppearance.Raised;
this.gridControl1[0,3].ImageList = this.imageList1;

// Some imagelist defined already.
// Some index in the imagelist.
this.gridControl1[0,3].ImageIndex = 1;
```

```vb
' GridControl
Me.gridControl1(0,3).CellType = "Static"
Me.gridControl1(0,3).CellAppearance = GridCellAppearance.Raised
Me.gridControl1(0,3).ImageList = imageList
Me.gridControl1(0,3).ImageIndex = 1

## 5.1.18 How to Optimize Pixel Scrolling in a GridControl

### Introduction

The grid's base class pixel scrolling is not optimized for large row scenarios. In the derived `GridControl`, you will have to override a couple of virtual methods to make it perform well and use binary tree structures to quickly get the row index for an absolute pixel position and vice versa.

Follow the steps that are given below to do this.

1. To Create a Custom derived `GridControl` and to override the following methods for Optimized Vertical scrolling.

   - RowIndexToVScrollPixelPos(int rowIndex)
   - VScrollPixelPosToRowIndex(int pixelPos, out int rowIndex, out int pixelDelta)
   - GetVScrollPixelHeight()

### Example

```csharp
public class DerivedGridControl : GridControl
{
    /// Get the Scroll Position for the pixel scrolling of a row.
}
```
