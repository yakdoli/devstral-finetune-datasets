# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the process of generating a composite GridStyleInfo object for a particular cell in a Grid control.
- Explains the precedence order for properties between cell-specific, rowstyle, columnstyle, tablestyle, and standardstyle.

## Content

### GridStyleInfo Object Generation
When Grid control needs to generate a composite GridStyleInfo object for a particular cell, it follows these steps:

1. **Cell-Specific GridStyleInfo**: First, it looks at any property that may be specifically set in a stored cell GridStyleInfo object (if one exists).
2. **RowStyle**: If there are properties not set in the cell-specific GridStyleInfo object, Grid control then picks up the rowstyle GridStyleInfo for this cell.
3. **ColumnStyle**: If properties are still unset, it retrieves properties from the columnstyle GridStyleInfo.
4. **TableStyle**: If properties are still unset, it retrieves properties from the tablestyle GridStyleInfo.
5. **StandardStyle**: Finally, it retrieves properties from the standardstyle GridStyleInfo.

Through this process, Grid control builds a fully populated composite GridStyleInfo object that combines properties from all relevant styles.

### Effect of GridStyleInheritance
The following graphic illustrates the effect of using the GridStyleInfo inheritance to determine the appearance of a cell (3, 2). Even though the BackColor property is set in each of the tablestyle, rowstyle, and columnstyle objects, the cell-specific style ultimately determines the back color of the cell.

#### Explanation
- **Cell 3,2**: When multiple BackColor properties are set in different styles, the cell-specific GridStyleInfo takes precedence.
- The BackColor property values in the table dynamically update based on the selected checkboxes, demonstrating the precedence order.

### Removing Cell-Specific BackColor Property
The next graphic shows the effect of removing the BackColor property from the cell-specific style. In this case:
- If the cell-specific style does not set BackColor, the rowstyle determines the back color for the cell.
- If the rowstyle BackColor is also removed, then the columnstyle BackColor determines the displayed color.
- Experimenting with different parent styles (cell-specific, rowstyle, columnstyle, tablestyle, and standardstyle) can further demonstrate the precedence order.

#### Suggested Experimentation
- Run the GridStyleInfo sample application to experiment with making different styles contribute to the cell's displayed color.
- Observe how the BackColor property is determined based on the selected styles.

## Summary
- The Grid control uses a hierarchical precedence to determine the composite GridStyleInfo for a cell, starting from the most specific (cell-specific) to the most general (standardstyle).
- Understanding this inheritance helps in designing consistent and customizable Grid controls in Windows Forms applications.

## API Reference
- **GridStyleInfo**: Contains properties for styling Grid cells such as BackColor, ForeColor, etc.
- **Cell-specific, RowStyle, ColumnStyle, TableStyle, StandardStyle**: These are different levels of styling that can be applied to Grid cells.
