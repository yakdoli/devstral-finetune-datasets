# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Instructions on how to customize the grid control in .NET by hiding row and column headers.
- Focus on preventing RangeStyles from being serialized into generated code in derived GridControl.

## Content

```csharp
// Hiding the 1, 2, 3 in the row headers.
this.gridControl1.Model.Options.NumberedRowHeaders = false;
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

' Hiding the A, B, C in the column headers.
Me.GridControl1.Model.Options.NumberedColHeaders = False

' Hiding the 1, 2, 3 in the row headers.
Me.GridControl1.Model.Options.NumberedRowHeaders = False
```

### 5.1.4 How to Avoid RangeStyles being Written out to Code in a Derived GridControl

#### Overview
- Explanation of how to avoid serializing styles in a derived grid when dropped on a form during design-time.
- Instructions on overriding properties to set them to `DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden`.

#### Detailed Instructions
When a derived grid is dropped onto a form at design-time, the styles changed in the derived grid's constructor will be written out as code in the form. This serialization of code can be avoided by overriding the respective properties and setting `DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden`.

As an example, the RangeStyles being serialized to code can be avoided by overriding the RangeStyles and setting it to `DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden`.

#### Code Example

```csharp
[Browsable(false), 
DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden)]
public new GridRangeStyleCollection RangeStyles
{
    get
    {
        return base.RangeStyles;
    }
    set
    {
        base.RangeStyles = value;
    }
}
```

```vb
[VB.NET]
```

## API Reference

### `DesignerSerializationVisibilityAttribute`
- **Purpose**: Indicates whether a property or event should be serialized during design-time.
- **Options**: 
  - `Default`: The property is serialized.
  - `Hidden`: The property is not serialized.
  - `Content`: The property is serialized with its child properties.

## Code Examples

The examples provided demonstrate how to prevent the serialization of RangeStyles in a derived GridControl, ensuring that changes made in the constructor do not get written into the form's code.
