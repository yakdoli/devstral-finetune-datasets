| (a) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user vision shall be provided, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are blind or visually impaired shall be provided.       | Fully Supported         | Syncfusion Essential Windows Grid satisfies the requirements for the blind or visually-impaired in several operations.                                                                                     |
| (b) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require visual acuity greater than 20/70 shall be provided in audio and enlarged print output working together or independently, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are visually impaired shall be provided. | Not Applicable          | This criterion does not apply to Essential Grid controls.                                                                                                                                               |
| (c) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user -hearing shall be provided, or support for Assistive Technology used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing shall be provided.            | Fully Supported         | Essential Grid controls have the support for retrieving information which doesn't require user hearing.                                                                                                       |
| (d) Where audio information is important for the use of a product, at least one mode of operation and information retrieval shall be provided in an enhanced auditory fashion, or support.                                               | Not Applicable          | Audio related functionality does not apply to Essential Grid controls.                                                                                                                                   |
