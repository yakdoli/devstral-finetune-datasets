## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Generating a Dataset

The following steps outline the process of generating a dataset for use in a Windows Forms application:

1. **Choose a dataset option:**
   - **Existing**: Select this if you want to use an existing dataset.
   - **New**: Create a new dataset by entering a name in the provided field. For example, "DataSet1".

2. **Choose which table(s) to add to the dataset:**
   - Select the tables you want to include in the dataset. In this example, the "Products (sqlDataAdapter1)" table is selected.

3. **Add dataset to the designer:**
   - Ensure that the "Add this dataset to the designer" checkbox is checked to include the dataset in the design surface.

### Steps to Follow

11. Press **OK** to add a **DataSet1** object next to the **sqlConnection1** under the design surface.

12. From the toolbox, drag the **Grid Data Bound Grid** control to your form. Size and position it, and add a button labeled **Update** to your form.

## Summary

This process demonstrates how to generate a new dataset and integrate it into your Windows Forms application. The steps include selecting the dataset options, adding and configuring the grid control, and placing a button for updating the data.
