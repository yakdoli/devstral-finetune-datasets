## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### 5.2.16 How to Prevent Showing the '+' Sign Next to the Parent Rows with no Children

#### Introduction

To hide the expansion indicator that reflects that no children are present at the parent row in a hierarchical grid, you will need to handle the CellDrawn and CellButtonClick Event.

Follow the steps given below.

1.  In the CellDrawn Event Handler, to assign the number of children in the parent row, to count and to paint the current cell with **BackgroundColor** if count equals to zero.

### Example

```csharp
[C#]

private void gridDataBoundGrid1_CellDrawn(object sender,
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridDrawCellEventArgs e)
{
    if (flag)
    {
        if (e.ColIndex == 1)
        {
            // Retrieve the record state of a row.
            GridBoundRecordState state =
                this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Binder.GetRecordStateAtRowIndex(e.RowIndex);

            count = 0;

            // Check its Hierarchy Level Index.
            if (state.LevelIndex == 0)
            {
                this.gridDataBoundGrid1.BeginUpdate();

                this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Model.SuspendChangeEvents();

                // To expand the rowIndex for finding the
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## API Reference (if applicable)

### Note
- The code example provided demonstrates how to handle the CellDrawn event to hide the '+' sign next to parent rows that have no children.
- The `GridBoundRecordState` is used to determine the record state of a row, including its hierarchy level.

### Code Examples (multi-language supported)

1. The provided C# code snippet shows how to implement the logic to hide the '+' sign for parent rows with no children in a hierarchical grid.
   ```csharp
   this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Model.SuspendChangeEvents();
   // Code to expand rowIndex for finding children.
   ```
