# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

You can enable filtering for the grid based on GridDataBoundGrid, by adding a row of drop-down cells at the top of a simple (non-hierarchical) Grid Data Bound Grid. This allows you to filter match values from the drop-down. This control also supports filter by DisplayMember.

**Note:** For more details, refer to the following section:

[Filtering a Grid Data Bound Grid](Filtering a Grid Data Bound Grid)

## Sample

A sample of this feature is available in the following location:

`<Install Location>\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\[Version Number]\Windows\Grid.Windows\Samples\2.0\Data Bound\Filter By DisplayMember Demo`

### 1.3.6.1 Filter for Specific Columns

When a filter is wired to a grid, it is wired to the entire grid. This makes it difficult to use different filters (e.g., dynamic filter, Excel-style filter, and filter by display member) in a single grid.

Here is a short description of each filter:

- **Dynamic Filter**窶認ilters the content using a list of comparison operators.
- **Ordinary Filter**窶認ilters the content based on the selected text and index.
- **Excel-Style Filter**窶認ilters the content based on multiple values and can sort the results, similar to Microsoft Excel filtering.
- **Filter by Display Member**窶認ilters the content by displaying the member instead of the value member of a combo-box column.

This feature enhances the use of different filters within a single grid. The filters are wired to each column by changing the cell type of the corresponding column, which enables users to apply many filters.

A filter can be applied to an individual column by setting the `AllowIndividualColumnWiring` property of the filter to `true`.
