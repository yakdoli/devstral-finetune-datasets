# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Implements IList Members, ICollection Members, and IEnumerable Members for the grid.
- Demonstrates the use of ITypedList Members for customizing grid properties.
- Explains how to integrate a button and listbox to manage grid interactions.

### Implementation Details

```vb
Set
    End Set
End Property

' Other IList Members.
...............
...............

' ICollection Members.
...............
...............

' IEnumerable Members.
...............
...............

' ITypedList Members.
Public Function GetItemProperties(ByVal listAccessors As PropertyDescriptor) As PropertyDescriptorCollection Implements ITypedList.GetItemProperties
    Dim pds As PropertyDescriptorCollection =
        TypeDescriptor.GetProperties(GetType(VirtualItem))
    Dim atts As String() = New String() {"Index", "Name", "SomeValue", "OtherValue"}
    Return pds.Sort(atts)
End Function

Public Function GetListName(ByVal listAccessors As PropertyDescriptor) As String Implements ITypedList.GetListName
    Return "VirtualList"
End Function
End Class
```

### Integration with Windows Forms

To enhance the user interface, follow these steps:

1. Add a button and a listbox to the main form.
2. Attach an event handler to the button click event.
3. In the event handler, create a grid grouping control and populate it with a Virtual List.
4. Use the ListBox as a Log Window to display log messages such as time elapsed for loading the grid and applied optimizations.

**Example Steps at Design Time:**

```vb
' 1. Add a button and listbox to the main form.
' 2. Handle the button click event.
'
'.Event Procedure
Private Sub btnLoadGrid_Click(sender As System.Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnLoadGrid.Click
    ' Create a grid grouping control and load it with the Virtual List.
    Dim grid As New GridGroupingControl
    ' ... [Code to initialize and load the grid with Virtual List]
    ' Update the ListBox with log messages
    ListBox1.Items.Add("Loading grid took: " & elapsed.ToString() & " ms")
    ListBox1.Items.Add("Optimizations applied: " & optimizationsApplied.ToString())
End Sub
```

**Note:** The ListBox serves as the Log Window where relevant log messages are displayed, providing insights into the performance and configuration of the grid.
