# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates integrating Grid Record Navigation Control and Grid Data Bound Grid within a form for efficient data handling.
- Explains the process of dragging and embedding grids for navigation and data binding.

## Content

### Grid Record Navigation Control
- The Grid Record Navigation Control helps navigate through records in a data-bound grid efficiently.
- **Figure 231:** Shows the Grid Record Navigation Control dragged onto the Form.

### Grid Data Bound Grid
- The Grid Data Bound Grid is a powerful tool for displaying and managing data in a tabular format.
- Dragging the Grid Data Bound Grid onto the Grid Record Navigation control is the next step in data integration.
- **Figure 232:** Illustrates the Grid Data Bound Grid dragged onto the Grid Record Navigation Control.

### Steps for Integration
1. Drag the Grid Record Navigation Control onto the form.
2. Drag the Grid Data Bound Grid onto the Grid Record Navigation control.
