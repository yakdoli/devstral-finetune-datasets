### 4.2 Grid Data Bound Grid

The Grid Data Bound Grid has been designed to be used as a grid that is bound to a data source such as an ADO.NET dataset or data table. It can be used with either flat or hierarchical data sources; does not include grouping support. No data values are stored in a GridDataBoundGrid object. The Grid Data Bound Grid is more column-centric than the Grid control as it is data bound. Its GridBoundColumns collection property will maintain an array of GridBoundColumn objects that will hold information like HeaderText, MappingName, and a GridStyleInfo object that holds the style properties for the column.
