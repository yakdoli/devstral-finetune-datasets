# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Content

### Grid Properties

The following properties are related to controlling the appearance and behavior of the grid.

#### Text Color Property

- **Figure 170: Grid with Text Color set to MidnightBlue**

  ![Grid with Text Color set to MidnightBlue](image.png)

**Figure 170** illustrates a grid where the text color is set to MidnightBlue. This property is used to specify the color of the text within the grid cells.

#### BackColor Property

- **BackColor**: Specifies the color of the grid line marker when the user resizes rows or columns by dragging the row or column headers. Default value is set to Red.

This property determines the background color of the grid lines when they are being resized. Examples can be used to set this property in different programming languages.

#### Setting BackColor in C#

1. **Using C#**

   ```csharp
   // Set the grid background color.
   this.gridControl1.BackColor = Color.Beige;
   ```

   This code snippet shows how to set the background color of the grid to Beige using C#.

#### Setting BackColor in VB.NET

2. **Using VB.NET**

   ```vb.net
   ' Set the grid background color.
   Me.gridControl1.BackColor = Color.Beige
   ```

   This example demonstrates setting the grid's background color to Beige using VB.NET.

#### Result of Setting BackColor

The following illustration shows how the Grid in "Figure 1" is transformed when the **BackColor** property is set to **Beige**.
