Public Shared InDoEvents As Boolean = False
Private Sub button1_Click(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs)
    Me.gridControl1.BeginUpdate()
    Me.gridControl1.Refresh()
    
    Console.WriteLine("before Application.DoEvents")
    Form1.InDoEvents = True
    Application.DoEvents()
    Form1.InDoEvents = False
    Console.WriteLine("after Application.DoEvents")
    
    Me.gridControl1.EndUpdate()
End Sub
Public Class MyGridControl
    Inherits GridControl
    Public Const WM_PAINT As Integer = 15
    Protected Overrides Sub WndProc(ByRef msg As System.Windows.Forms.Message)
        If Form1.InDoEvents AndAlso msg.Msg = WM_PAINT Then
            DefWndProc(msg)

### 5.4.49 How can I implement an Excel accounting format in the Syncfusion WinForms GridControl?

We can achieve this behavior by setting the cell type to Currency. The currency symbol is removed from the cell data with the following code:

```csharp
[C#]
this.gridControl1[i, j].CurrencyEdit.CurrencySymbol = "";
```

```vb
[VB]
Me.gridControl1[i, j].CurrencyEdit.CurrencySymbol = "";
```
```
