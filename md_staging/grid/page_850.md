# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Developers can use the Essential Grid for Windows Forms to manage data presentation in desktop applications.
- Tips on how to set appearance properties effectively for different types of cells in the grid.
- Explanation of how to disable themes to see the effects of appearance properties on specific cells.

## Content

### Note:
When using Preview, make sure that you set `ThemesEnabled` to `False`, if you want to see the effect of setting the property on a header cell or a button type cell. If you do not, then the theme appearance will supersede the appearance properties you set here.

Some of the properties are not applicable unless the item they affect is used in the grid. For example, properties that affect nested tables or summaries will not change the appearance of a Grid Grouping control that does not have either of these items. In later tutorials, you will be able to test such properties.
