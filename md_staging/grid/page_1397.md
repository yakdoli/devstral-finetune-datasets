# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Introduction

- The example given below has a helper class which, supports the automatic sizing in both a GridControl or a GridDataBoundGrid in two ways.
- One way which, is referred to as proportional sizing, is where all the columns in the grid are equally sized.
- The other technique which, is used is referred to as the percentage sizing allows you to specify that certain columns should occupy certain percentages of the available space for these columns.

## Sizing Methods

### Proportional Sizing
- The **WireGrid** and **UnwireGrid** are methods that are used to enable the sizing of the helper class.
- Proportional sizing is achieved by using the **QueryColWidth** event.

### Percentage Sizing
- Percentage sizing will explicitly set the **ColWidth[index]** property for each column.

## Example

```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    DataTable dt = new DataTable();
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        dt.Columns.Add();
        dt.Rows.Add(new object[] { });
    }
    this.gridDataBoundGrid1.DataSource = dt;

    // There is a condition check in accepting hashtable values.
    // ie.. the total of values passed must not be greater than (100 - Unmodified Column count)
    ht = new Hashtable();
    ht.Add(1, 20);
    ht.Add(9, 30);
    ht.Add(4, 13);

    // Attempts like using unwanted keys are not encouraged because count is being used.
    // ie.. ht.Add(12,100);
    Helper1 = new GridColSizingHelper();
    Helper2 = new GridColSizingHelper();
    Helper2.WireGrid(this.gridControl1, ht);
    this.gridDataBoundGrid1.AllowResizeToFit = false;
    Helper1.WireGrid(this.gridDataBoundGrid1, ht);
}
