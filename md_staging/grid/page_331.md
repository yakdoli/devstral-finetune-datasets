# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The page describes various functions used in the Essential Grid for Windows Forms. These include:
  - The `ODD` function, which rounds numbers to the nearest odd integer.
  - The `OR` function, which evaluates multiple logical conditions.
  - The `PEARSON` function, which calculates the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient.

## Content

### 4.1.4.6.6.175 ODD
**Returns the number rounded up to the nearest odd integer.**

#### Syntax
```plaintext
ODD(number), where:
- number is the value to be rounded off.
```

#### Remarks
- Regardless of the sign of a number, a value is rounded up when adjusted away from zero. If the number is an odd integer, no rounding occurs.

### 4.1.4.6.6.176 OR
**Returns True if any argument is True; returns False if all arguments are False.**

#### Syntax
```plaintext
OR(logical1, logical2, ...), where:
- logical1, logical2, ... are conditions you want to test that can be either True or False.
```

#### Remarks
- The arguments must evaluate to logical values such as True or False or in arrays or references that contain logical values.

### 4.1.4.6.6.177 PEARSON
**Returns the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, r, a dimensionless index that ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 inclusive and reflects the extent of a linear relationship between two data sets.**
