# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
if (e.Action == CurrentRecordAction.EndEditComplete)
{
    e.Record.InvalidateCounterBottomUp();
    this.gridGroupingControl.Refresh();
}
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Private Sub gridGroupingControl1_CurrentRecordContextChange(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As CurrentRecordContextChangeEventArgs)
    If (e.Action = CurrentRecordAction.EndEditComplete) Then
        e.Record.InvalidateCounterBottomUp()
        Me.gridGroupingControl1.Refresh()
    End If
End Sub
```

## 4.3.4.13.4 Custom Filter Dialog

When you have a grouping grid with filter bar enabled, the drop down in a filter bar cell shows a 'Custom' option too along with other filtering options. This option allows you to customize the filtering mechanism. By default, the custom option pops up the RecordFieldDescriptor collection editor for the table. This default behavior must be overridden when a custom defined filter dialog has to be displayed as a result of clicking the custom option. It can be achieved by replacing the default FilterBarCell with custom defined filter bar cell.

This section best demonstrates merging of user defined filter dialog with the grid filter bar and also explores the code to implement it.

### Implementation

To adopt our own filter dialog with respect to the 'Custom' filtering option, we must define a Custom Filter CellType which should then replace the filter bar cell that is shown by default.

In general, a celltype requires a model class and a renderer class. The model class handles the serialization requirements for the control and creates the renderer class. The renderer class handles the UI requirements of the cell, such as drawing it, handling mouse actions, and so on.
