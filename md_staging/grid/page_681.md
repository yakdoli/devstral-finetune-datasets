### 4.3.4.2.3.2 IBindingList

#### Overview

This section demonstrates the implementation of IBindingList and how to bind this list to a Grid Grouping control. As IBindingList derives from IList, its implementation requires the implementation of all of the members of the IList, ICollection, and IEnumerable interfaces.

#### Benefits

The benefits of using IBindingList include the support for change notifications when the list is modified. It includes a `ListChanged` event, which will be fired upon any data changes. If the collection supports changes, it should also support firing a `ListChanged` event when the collection changes. To indicate that the collection should return `true` from the `SupportsChangeNotification` property. Hence, when items are added or removed from the collection, the grouping grid will be notified of these changes and will update itself automatically.

#### Implementation Procedure

Follow these steps to create your own collection that implements IBindingList and to bind this collection to a grouping grid.

    <tr>
      <th>CategoryID</th>

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Condiments</td>
