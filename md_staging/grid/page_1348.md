## Overview
- Alpha constants used with match and like should be enclosed in apostrophes.
- Documentation of operators such as *, /, +, -, <, >, =, <=, >=, match, like, in, between, or, and * for expressions.
- Setting the type of output view to double type.
- Code examples in both C# and VB.NET for setting up expressions.

### Expression Setup

#### C#

// Alpha constants used with match and like should be enclosed in apostrophes (').
// *, /, +, -, <, >, =, <=, >=, match, like, in, between, or, and * operator used here.
ExpressionFieldDescriptor exp = new ExpressionFieldDescriptor("Expr1", "[ColumnName] *2", "System.Int32");

// 2. Setting the output/view type.
// Output in double type.
ExpressionFieldDescriptor exp = new ExpressionFieldDescriptor("Expr1", "[ColumnName] *2", "System.Double");

#### [VB]

' 1. Setting the operators in the expression.
' Setting operators in the expression.
' The computations are performed with level one operations done first.
' Alpha constants used with match and like should be enclosed in apostrophes ('.
' *, /, +, -, <, >, =, <=, >=, match, like, in, between, or, and
' * operator used here.
Dim exp As ExpressionFieldDescriptor = New ExpressionFieldDescriptor("Expr1", "[Id] *2", "System.Int32")

' 2. Setting the output in double type.
Dim exp2 As ExpressionFieldDescriptor = New ExpressionFieldDescriptor("Expr2", "[Expr1] *2", "System.Double")
