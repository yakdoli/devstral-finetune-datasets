### Appearance

The appearance of every grid element can be customized by accessing the Appearance property. It allows you to set GridStyleInfo properties like cell type, value, back color, font, etc. for grid cells. It holds a sub tree of different grid elements each with its own set of formatting properties. For instance, when you want to set appearance for alternate record field cell, you can make use of Appearance.AlternateRecordFieldCell property; if you want to customize summary cells, you will have to use Appearance.SummaryFieldCell or related property.
