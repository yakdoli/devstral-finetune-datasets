## Code Examples

### Example: Implementing a Fill Paste in the Grid
```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid;
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms;

// Example of filling contents in selected cells
private void gridControl1_CellFillPaste(object sender, GridCellFillPasteEventArgs e)
{
    GridControl grid = sender as GridControl;
    // Implement Fill Paste logic here
    if (e.SelectedCells.Count > 0)
    {
        object value = grid[e.TopRow, e.LeftCol].CellValue;
        foreach (GridCellRendererBase cell in e.SelectedCells)
        {
            cell.SetValue(value);
        }
    }
}
```
