### 1.3.6 Filtering

#### GridGroupingControl
This control enables you to specify the logical condition for filtering. Similar to an Expression Field, this control also provides you the option of typing an expression or entering a condition using an editor dialog for filtering.

#### Filterbar
Grouping Grid provides in-built support for displaying a `Filter Bar` across the columns. It can be used to filter and clear filter at run time. This is user interactive and has more advantages. One of the main reasons for its wide usage is its ability to display various filter options for the columns. You can also add your own filter criteria.

#### Dynamic filter
Dynamic Filter serves as a good replacement for the Filter Bar. This provides advanced filtering capabilities. It is built on the foundation of the regular filter bar with added provisions to support dynamic filtering. The dynamic filter can be used with Nested Tables and Nested Groups.

**Note:** For more details, refer to the following section:

- **Record Filtering**
