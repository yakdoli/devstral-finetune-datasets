### Grid with Stacked Headers

#### Figure 355: Grouping Grid with Stacked Headers

The figure showcases a grid with a "Stacked Headers" feature, where columns are grouped under two header rows labeled "Header1" and "Header2". The stacked header row "Stacked Header Row 2" is highlighted, indicating that it contains multiple columns grouped under this header.

The grid displays the following data:

#### Figure 356: Rearranging Stacked Headers by dragging and dropping Header2

This figure illustrates the process of rearranging stacked headers by dragging and dropping the "Header2" label. The action shown allows users to reorganize grouped columns within the grid dynamically.

The process involves:

1. Clicking and holding the "Header2" label.
2. Dragging the label to the desired position.
3. Releasing the label to drop it into the new location.

This feature enhances userinteractivity and provides flexibility in organizing data within the grid.
