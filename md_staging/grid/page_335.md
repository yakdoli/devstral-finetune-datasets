# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Content

### Remarks

- Number must be > 0 and `number_chosen` must be >= 0.
- Number must be >= `number_chosen`.
- The equation for the number of permutations is,

\[ P _ { k , n } = \frac{n !}{( n - k ) !} \]

### PERMUTATIONA

**4.1.4.6.6.184 PERMUTATIONA**

The PERMUTATIONA function returns the number of permutations for a given number of objects (with repetitions) that can be selected from the total number of objects.

#### Syntax

PERMUTATIONA(number, number-chosen) where:
- `number` is an integer that describes the total number of objects.
- `number-chosen` is an integer that describes the number of objects in each permutation.

#### Remarks:
- `#VALUE!` - occurs if numeric arguments use data types that are non-numeric.
- `#NUM!` - occurs if numeric arguments are values that are not valid.
- Both arguments are truncated to integers.

### PI

**4.1.4.6.6.185 PI**

Returns the number 3.14159265358979, the mathematical constant pi, accurate to 15 digits.

#### Syntax

PI()

### PMT

**4.1.4.6.6.186 PMT**

Calculates the payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.
