# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates the grid grouping control with row heights resized.
- Explains the GridDynamicFilter class and its integration with the Grid Grouping control.
- Describes the features and functionality of the custom filter bar.

## Content

### 4.7.3 Grid Dynamic Filter

The GridDynamicFilter class is used to wire a custom filter bar to the Grid Grouping control by replacing the default filter bar. The existing filter bar logic is extended to make the filter easy to use. This feature displays filtered results as you type each character.

The new filter bar adds two cell buttons, **Filter** button and **Clear Filter** button, inside every filter bar cell. The **Filter** button is used to display a list of the available Compare Operators in a drop-down. The selected operator will then be associated with the value present in the filter bar cell to form a filter string. The **Clear Filter** button, as its name indicates, clears the record filters of the respective column. This button will be displayed for a filter bar cell, only when that particular cell is in focus.

#### Example Code

The following code example illustrates how to invoke the Grid Dynamic Filter:

```csharp
// Invoking the Grid Dynamic Filter
gridDynamicFilter.FilterControl = gdvProducts.DynamicFilter;
```
