### Configuring Data Sources

#### Step 5: Select Database and Data Connection

1. **Data Source Type**: Set the `Data Source Type` to "Database" in the `Data Source Configuration Wizard Dialog Box`.

2. **Select Connection**: Choose the appropriate data connection and click `Next`. This example uses the Northwind database, which is available at the following path:

   ```
   <Sample Install Location>\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\x.x.x\Common\Data
   ```

#### Step 6: Select Appropriate Table and Data

1. **Select Table and Data**: Use the `Data Source Configuration Wizard` to select the appropriate table and data for your application.

   **Instructions**:
   - Click `New Connection...` to configure a new database connection.
   - Review and select the data connection you wish to use (e.g., `NORTHWND.MDF`).
   - Decide if you want to include sensitive data in the connection string or exclude it for increased security.
   - After setting up the connection, proceed to select the relevant tables and data using the wizard.
