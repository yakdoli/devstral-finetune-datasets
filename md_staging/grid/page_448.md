# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### BlackWhite-Specifies if the grid should be printed only in black and white.

The following code examples illustrate how to set this property:

#### 1. Using C#

```csharp
[C#]

// Specify if the grid should print only in black and white.
this.gridControl1.Properties.BlackWhite = true;
```

#### 2. Using VB.NET

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

' Specify if the grid should print only in black and white.
Me.gridControl1.Properties.BlackWhite = True
```

### Printing-Prints the grid.

The following code examples illustrate how to set this property:

#### 1. Using C#

```csharp
[C#]

// Prints the grid.
this.gridControl1.Properties.Printing = true;
```

#### 2. Using VB.NET

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

' Prints the grid.
Me.gridControl1.Properties.Printing = True
```

### PrintFrame-Specifies the appearance of a frame around the grid while printing.

The following code examples illustrate how to set this property:

#### 1. Using C#

```csharp
[C#]

```

## API Reference (if applicable)

The provided code examples demonstrate how to configure the `BlackWhite`, `Printing`, and `PrintFrame` properties of a grid control in a Windows Forms application using both C# and VB.NET. These properties are particularly useful for controlling the visual appearance and printing behavior of grids.

### Code Examples

The examples provided showcase the use of the `gridControl1.Properties` object to adjust the properties required for printing. Adjustments for `BlackWhite` and `Printing` are demonstrated in both languages, allowing developers to specify whether the grid should be printed in black and white and whether printing is enabled. The `PrintFrame` property is similarly configured in C#.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

The sections cover essential grid printing functionalities and their implementation in Windows Forms, providing a clear flow of instructions for developers. Each code example is structured to ensure ease of understanding and adoption.
