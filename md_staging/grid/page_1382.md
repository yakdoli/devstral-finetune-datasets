## 5.4.2 How to Capture Function Keys When the Current Cell is in Active Edit Mode

### Introduction

While the grid cell is not actively being edited, the grid itself will get these keystrokes. In this case, event handlers like grid.CurrentCellKeyDown and grid.KeyDown can be used to catch the keys.

But, when the current cell is actively being edited, the grid does not automatically catch these keys. In this case, you can use the `Grid.CurrentCellControlKeyMessage` to catch the function keys. You will have to manually subscribe to it. Note that this event may be hit multiple times for each keystroke (eg., for both KeyDown and KeyUp). You can check the e.Msg property to see what key message is being processed by your event handler.

### Example

```csharp
[C#]
// Subscribe to the event.
this.grid.CurrentCellControlKeyMessage += new GridCurrentCellControlKeyMessageEventHandler
```

```csharp
End Sub
```
