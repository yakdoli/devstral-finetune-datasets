# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
// Sets a different value in the next row.
gridControl[rowIndex, colIndex].CellValue = 3.14159;
```

```vb.net
' Setting the CellValues of the cell.
Dim rowIndex As Integer = 1
Dim colIndex As Integer = 2
GridControl(rowIndex, colIndex).CellValue = "PI"
rowIndex = rowIndex + 1

' Sets a different value in the next row.
GridControl(rowIndex, colIndex).CellValue = 3.14159
```

### Note:

Using an indexer on the GridControl to set values will trigger several notification events that listeners (and the GridControl itself) can use to monitor the state of the GridControl. These events may slow things down if you have a lot of data to move into the GridControl. In this case, you can want to employ a technique that will avoid these events.

There are several ways to do this; if your data is in some form supported by the GridControl.PopulateValues method, you can use that method to move such data into the GridControl. Another option is to use the GridControl.SetCellInfo method, by passing it appropriate parameters to avoid the notification events. But, if you are only setting a few values or you need the notification events to be raised, then using an indexer is a straight-forward way to accomplish this task.

## 5.1.26 How to Set the Text in a Header Cell

### Introduction

In a GridControl, values in header cells are set just as in any other cell.

### Example

Use an indexer on your GridControl with the row index set to 0.

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
```
