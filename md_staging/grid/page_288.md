# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Explains the use of degrees of freedom for statistical calculations.
- Describes the F distribution and its inverse function (FINV) for comparing variability between two data sets.
- Provides arguments and remarks for valid input and potential errors.

## Content

### Degrees Freedom

- **degrees_freedom1** is the numerator degrees of freedom.
- **degrees_freedom2** is the denominator degrees of freedom.

#### Remarks

- All arguments must be numeric.
- X must be >= 0.
- Both degrees_freedom1 and degrees_freedom2 must be >= 1 and < \(10^{10}\).
- FDIST is calculated as \( FDIST = P(F > x) \), where F is a random variable with an F distribution having degrees_freedom1 and degrees_freedom2 degrees of freedom.

### 4.1.4.6.6.89 FINV

The Finv function returns the inverse of the F probability distribution. If \( p = FDIST(x, ...) \), then \( FINV(p, ...) = x \).

Using F distribution, you can compare the degree of variability for two data sets.

#### Syntax

```csharp
FINV(probability, deg_freedom1, deg_freedom2)
```

#### Arguments

The FINV function syntax has the following three arguments:

- **Probability**: A probability associated with the F cumulative distribution.
- **Deg_freedom1**: The numerator degrees of freedom.
- **Deg_freedom2**: The denominator degrees of freedom.

#### Remarks

- **#NUM!**: Occurs if probability is equal to or less than zero.
- **#NUM!**: Occurs if probability is equal to or greater than 1.
- **#VALUE!**: Occurs if probability is non-numeric.
- **#NUM!**: Occurs if deg_freedom1 is less than one.
- **#VALUE!**: Occurs if deg_freedom1 is non-numeric.
- **#NUM!**: Occurs if deg_freedom2 is less than one.
- **#VALUE!**: Occurs if deg_freedom2 is non-numeric.
