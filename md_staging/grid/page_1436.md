## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Overview
- Demonstrates how to customize the row height for individual rows in the Essential Grid.
- Allows resizing rows based on the content size.
- Provides a clear example using `GridResizingRows` event handling.

### Content

This section explains how to dynamically adjust the height of individual rows in the `Essential Grid` for Windows Forms. The example below illustrates how to ensure the row height is sufficiently large to accommodate its content. The code snippet accomplishes this by measuring the height of the text in the row and setting the row height accordingly. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

#### Initialization
The `GridEngineFactory` is configured to allow resizing of individual rows. This is achieved using the `AllowResizingIndividualRows()` method:

```csharp
GridEngineFactory.Factory = new Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.AllowResizingIndividualRows();
```

#### Handling Row Resizing
The `GridResizingRows` event is used to customize the row height. When the user initiates a resizing action (e.g., double-clicking the row handle), the event handler measures the height of the text in the row and sets the row height accordingly.

```csharp
void grid_ResizingRows(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridResizingRowsEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Reason == GridResizeCellsReason.DoubleClick)
    {
        Graphics graphics = CreateGraphics();
        long maxHeight = 0;
        GridStyleInfo style = this.grid.GetViewStyleInfo(e.Rows.Bottom, 1);
        textSize = graphics.MeasureString(style.Text, style.GdiFont, this.grid.Model.ColWidths[1]).ToSize();
        if (maxHeight < textSize.Height)
        {
            maxHeight = (long)textSize.Height;
        }
        this.grid.Model.RowHeights[e.Rows.Bottom] = (int)maxHeight;
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}
```

- **Graphics**: Used to measure the size of the text in the row.
- **GridStyleInfo**: Retrieves the font and text information for the row.
- **MeasureString**: Measures the size of the text based on the font and column width.
- **RowHeights**: Sets the height of the row based on the measured text size.

### API Reference

#### Methods and Properties Used
- `GridEngineFactory.Factory`: Sets the factory for the grid engine.
  - **Type**: `GridEngineFactory`
  - **Purpose**: Configures the grid to allow resizing of individual rows.
  
- `GridResizingRowsEventArgs.Reason`: Indicates the reason for the resizing action.
  - **Type**: `GridResizeCellsReason`
  - **Purpose**: Determines the action that triggered the resizing (e.g., double-click).

- `GridStyleInfo.Text`, `GridStyleInfo.GdiFont`: Provides text and font information for the row.
  - **Type**: `string`, `Font`
  - **Purpose**: Used to measure the size of the text.

- `GridModel.ColWidths`: Retrieves the width of the column to measure text.
  - **Type**: `int`
  - **Purpose**: Used in conjunction with `MeasureString` to calculate text size.

- `GridModel.RowHeights`: Sets the height of the row.
  - **Type**: `int`
  - **Purpose**: Dynamically adjusts the row height based on the content.

### Code Examples

```csharp
[C#]
public Form1()
{
    // To customize the row height for individual row
    GridEngineFactory.Factory = new Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.AllowResizingIndividualRows();
    InitializeComponent();
}

Size textSize;
void grid_ResizingRows(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid.GridResizingRowsEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Reason == GridResizeCellsReason.DoubleClick)
    {
        Graphics graphics = CreateGraphics();
        long maxHeight = 0;
        GridStyleInfo style = this.grid.GetViewStyleInfo(e.Rows.Bottom, 1);
        textSize = graphics.MeasureString(style.Text, style.GdiFont, this.grid.Model.ColWidths[1]).ToSize();
        if (maxHeight < textSize.Height)
        {
            maxHeight = (long)textSize.Height;
        }
        this.grid.Model.RowHeights[e.Rows.Bottom] = (int)maxHeight;
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to dynamically adjust the row height in the `Essential Grid` for Windows Forms based on the content size. By utilizing the `GridResizingRows` event and measuring the text size, the grid provides a visually appealing and functional user interface.
