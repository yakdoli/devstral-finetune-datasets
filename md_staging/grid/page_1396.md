# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

Characters other than the number sign (#), the default, can be used to replace alphanumeric content that exceeds the size of a cell. To do so, set `AutoFitChar` to the desired character. For example, in the code samples below, the placeholder character has been changed to the at (@) character.

## Code Examples

### C#

```csharp
this.gridcontrol1[1,1]. AutoFitChar='@'
```

### VB

```vb
Me.gridcontrol1[1,1]. AutoFitChar='@'
```

## Custom Placeholder Characters
