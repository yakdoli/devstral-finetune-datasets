# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to use the `GridColSizingHelper` to manage column sizing in a grid.
- Highlights the use of a `Hashtable` to specify column sizes and proportions.
- Explains conditional checks for column sizing to ensure they don't exceed a certain limit.
- Includes events to handle wire/unwire operations and resize functionality.

## Content

The following code snippets showcase the use of `GridColSizingHelper` to size columns in the grid, with conditional checks for hashtable values. The examples include wiring/unwiring the grid to the helper, adjusting column sizing based on specified conditions, and handling percentage-based sizing during resizing.

```vb
' There is a condition check in accepting hashtable values.
' ie.. the total of values passed must not be greater than (100 - Unmodified Column count)
    ht = New Hashtable()
    ht.Add(1, 20)
    ht.Add(9, 30)
    ht.Add(4, 13)

    ' Attempts like using unwanted keys are not encouraged because count is being used.
    ' ht.Add(12, 100);
    Helper1 = New GridColSizingHelper()
    Helper2 = New GridColSizingHelper()
    Helper2.WireGrid(Me.gridControl1, ht)
    Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.AllowResizeToFit = False
    Helper1.WireGrid(Me.gridDataBoundGrid1, ht)
End Sub

Private Sub buttonAdv1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles buttonAdv1.Click
    Me.Helper1.UnwireGrid()
    Me.Helper2.UnwireGrid()
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_Resize(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Resize
    If Not Helper1 Is Nothing Then
        Me.Helper1.TurnOffProportion()
        Me.Helper1.TurnOnPercentages()
        Me.Helper2.TurnOffProportion()
        Me.Helper2.TurnOnPercentages()
    End If
End Sub

Private Sub buttonAdv2_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles buttonAdv2.Click
    Helper2.WireGrid(Me.gridControl1)
    Helper1.WireGrid(Me.gridDataBoundGrid1)
End Sub

Private Sub buttonAdv3_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles buttonAdv3.Click
    Helper2.WireGrid(Me.gridControl1, ht)
    Helper1.WireGrid(Me.gridDataBoundGrid1, ht)
End Sub

End Class
```

### Key Features
- **Conditional Column Sizing:** Ensures that the total of values passed in a hashtable does not exceed a specified limit based on unmodified column counts.
- **Dynamic Unwiring/Wiring:** Provides functionality to dynamically remove and reattach the column sizing helpers to the grid.
- **Percentage-Based Sizing:** Allows columns to maintain proportional sizing during form resizing.

## API Reference
- **Types:** `GridColSizingHelper`, `Hashtable`
- **Methods:**
  - `WireGrid(Grid, Hashtable)`
  - `UnwireGrid()`
  - `TurnOffProportion()`
  - `TurnOnPercentages()`

## Code Examples

The provided code examples demonstrate how to:
1. Create and populate a `Hashtable` with desired column sizes.
2. Use `GridColSizingHelper` to apply these sizes to the grid columns.
3. Dynamically manage the sizing based on form resizing and user interactions.
