- Explains the concept of events in the context of grid operations and event handling.
- Provides details on how to subscribe and unsubscribe from events related to group actions in the grid.

## Content

### WinForms-specific conventions
The GridGroupingControl in Syncfusion WinForms allows for the manipulation of grid-based data. Figure 392 illustrates the use of the "Optimize Filter" checkbox, which can be used to optimize filtering operations in the grid.

#### Events

#### 4.3.4.14 Events

An Event is a message that is triggered to notify an object or a class of the occurrence of an action. When an event gets fired, all the event handlers will be notified, i.e., the event handler functions will be invoked.

In order to receive the event notifications, the caller object must subscribe to the desired events. If you no longer want to listen to an event, then you can simply unsubscribe from the event notification. This section deals with some important events that are fired while performing group-related actions. They are organized into different categories based primarily on the grid component they affect and the functionality it provides.

In this section, you will learn about the following events.
