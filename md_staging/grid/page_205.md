| â—¦ Handles active editing of the cell. For example, if your custom control is a checked list box control, you will use this method to check the selected items in the embedded checked list box from information stored in the cell's style object.                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **OnDraw(Graphics g, Rectangle clientRectangle, int rowIndex, int colIndex, GridStyleInfo style)**          | Called to draw the contents of the client bounds for the cell, for example, the text for a static cell. If your cell has an active state, then normally there are two paths through OnDraw. One path draws the active cell and the other handles the drawing of the cell when it is not active. Override it when you want to draw the content of your cell.                                                                                                                |
| **OnKeyDown(KeyEventArgs e)**                                                                                | Called when the user presses a key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **OnKeyUp(KeyEventArgs e)**                                                                                  | Called when the user releases a key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **OnKeyPress(KeyPressEventArgs e)**                                                                          | Called for a user key press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **OnHitTest(int rowIndex, int colIndex, MouseEventArgs mouseEventArgs, IMouseController controller)**        | Override the OnHitTest in your derived cell renderer if you want to catch mouse events. If you want your renderer class to handle mouse actions like OnMouseDown or OnMouseMove, this OnHitTest should return a non-zero value. Otherwise, your mouse methods will not be called.                                                                                                                         |
| **OnMouseHoverLeave(int rowIndex, int colIndex, EventArgs e)**                                               | Called when your cell renderer has indicated in its OnHitTest override that it wants to receive mouse events, and that the user is moving the mouse out of the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **OnMouseHover(int rowIndex, int colIndex, MouseEventArgs e)**                                               | Called when your cell renderer has indicated in its OnHitTest override that it wants to receive mouse events, and that the user is moving the mouse over the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **OnMouseHoverEnter(int rowIndex, int colIndex)**                                                             | Called when your cell renderer has indicated in its OnHitTest override that it wants to receive mouse events, and that the user has moved the mouse into the cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
