# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Utilizes tree selection to dynamically filter grid data based on the selected node.
- Demonstrates how to integrate a filter bar with a grid and apply filters based on node selection.

## Content

### Tree Selection-Based Filtering

#### C#

```csharp
//Event Handler

private void treeViewAdv1_AfterSelect(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TreeNodeAdv node = treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode;

    if (node != null)
    {
        string filterString = string.Format("CategoryId = {0}", Convert.ToInt32(node.Tag));

        // Apply filter on grid

        filter.RowFilter = filterString;
        this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Refresh();
    }
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
// Include the below four lines of code in the constructor

treeViewAdv1.ExpandAll()
filter = New GridFilterBar()
' Associates Grid with the filter
filter.WireGrid(Me.gridDataBoundGrid1)
' Hide the filter bar row
Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.Model.Rows.Hidden(1) = True

// Event Handler

Private Sub treeViewAdv1_AfterSelect(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim node As TreeNodeAdv = treeViewAdv1.SelectedNode
End Sub
```

## API Reference

### Methods
- **TreeNodeAdv.SelectedNode**: Retrieves the currently selected node in the tree view.
- **Convert.ToInt32(node.Tag)**: Converts the tag of the selected node to an integer for use in the filter string.
- **GridFilterBar.RowFilter**: Sets the filtering criteria for the grid.
- **GridDataBoundGrid.Refresh()**: Refreshes the grid after applying the filter.

## Code Examples

The provided examples illustrate how to:
1. Set up a filter bar for a grid.
2. Integrate the filter bar with the grid programmatically.
3. Hide the filter bar row in the grid.
4. Dynamically apply a filter to the grid based on the selection in a tree view.

## Cross References
- Refer to grid-based documentation for more details on filtering and data binding.
- For additional information on tree views and their integration with grids, see the relevant section in the Syncfusion documentation.
