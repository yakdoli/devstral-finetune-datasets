![Data Link Properties Window](Figure 12: Click the Browse button to select the File)

The figure above shows the "Data Link Properties" window, a crucial dialog box in setting up a data connection. Here are the steps to configure it:

**1. Select or enter a database name:**  
In this section, you are prompted to specify the database you wish to connect to. This can either be done by selecting a database file or manually entering the database name.

**2. Enter information to log on to the database:**  
- **User name**: The dialog box already has an example entry with the username "Admin".
- **Password**: This field is left blank, indicating that no password is required for this example. Additionally, the "Blank password" checkbox is selected, signifying that a password is not necessary for authentication.
- **Allow saving password**: This option is unchecked, meaning that the password will not be saved upon connection.

**3. Test Connection**: After setting up the basic details, proceed by clicking the "Test Connection" button to ensure that the connection to the database can be successfully established.

**4. Finalizing the Connection Settings**: Once the connection is tested and confirmed to be successful, click the "OK" button to apply these settings and complete the configuration process.

5. Click the **Browse** button to browse and locate an `.mdb` file.
