**Description:**
The screenshot shows a demonstration of identifying a specific cell in the Syncfusion Grid. The cell corresponding to "CustomerID" 'WANDK' and "ContactName" 'Rita Müller' is highlighted. The Coded UI Test Builder is used to capture properties of this cell, such as its `FormattedText`, `CellHeight`, `ClassName`, and other details necessary for UI testing.

### Steps to Assert Cell Values

1. **Open the Coded UI Test Builder.**
   - Start by launching the Coded UI Test Builder to prepare for asserting cell values in the grid.
   
2. **Click the cross-hair present in the Coded UI Test builder.**
   - This tool allows you to identify specific UI elements, including grid cells.

3. **Hover the cross-hair over the desired cell.**
   - By hovering over a cell, you enable the tool to capture details about that cell.

4. **View the properties of the selected cell.**
   - The Assert window will display details such as `FormattedText`, `CellHeight`, `ClassName`, and more, which are crucial for UI testing assertions.

#### Instructions

5. ** Assert the cell value using the cross-hair present in the Coded UI Test builder.**
6. ** Click the cross-hair and hover to the cell. It will display the Assert window as shown in the following screenshot:**

### Description of the Assert Window

The Assert window provides the following details from the grid cell:
- **FormattedText:** The text content of the cell ('Rita Müller').
- **CellHeight:** The height of the cell (18).
- **ClassName:** The class type of the grid cell (`GridDataBoundGrid.Cell`).
- **FriendlyName:** A user-friendly identifier `[87, 3]`.
- **Other properties:** Details like `Exists`, `Enabled`, `Name`, and `IsTopParent` are also displayed for asserting additional properties.

### Summary

This section outlines the process of identifying and asserting the values of individual cells in the Syncfusion Grid using the Coded UI Test Builder. By following the provided steps, users can effectively capture and assert grid cell values, ensuring the accuracy of their UI tests.
