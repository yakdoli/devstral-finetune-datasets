- Demonstrates the use of the grid.
- Displays a filled series in Excel's interface.
- Outlines the process of dragging a cell to display January.

## Content

### Filled Series
**Figure 456: Filled Series**

![Screenshot of Excel Interface with Grid Data](https://example.com/screenshot_excel_grid)

The screenshot above shows a grid filled with various data points, where numbers and symbols are arranged in columns labeled A through L. The specific dataset includes a mix of numerical values and symbols, represented in a tabular format. The grid is part of a larger interface, indicating that it is integrated into a desktop application environment.

3. **Popup Menu**: The image shows the popup menu displayed after dragging the cell that displays January.

### Observation
The grid system illustrated here allows users to interact with data, including the ability to drag and drop cells to manipulate data layout or reference specific entries.

### Notes
- The grid supports various formatting options, visible in the toolbar at the top of the application window.
- The filled data series provides an example of how the grid can handle and display static and dynamic data.

## API Reference
- **Namespace**: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms
- **Class**: GridControl
- **Members**:
  - `FillSeries()`: Method for filling the grid with a series of data.
  - `DragDropEvent`: Event triggered when dragging and dropping cells in the grid.

## Code Examples

### C#
```csharp
// Example code to demonstrate grid functionality
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms;

// Assuming the GridControl is initialized and populated with data
GridControl myGrid = new GridControl();
// Fill the grid with a series
myGrid.FillSeries();
// Event handling for drag and drop
myGrid.DragDropEvent += (sender, e) => {
    // Perform specific actions on drag and drop
    Console.WriteLine("Dragged cell contains: " + e.DraggedCell.Text);
};
```

### VB.NET
```vb
Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms

' Assuming the GridControl is initialized and populated with data
Dim myGrid As New GridControl()
' Fill the grid with a series
myGrid.FillSeries()
' Event handling for drag and drop
AddHandler myGrid.DragDropEvent, Sub(sender, e)
                                      ' Perform specific actions on drag and drop
                                      Console.WriteLine("Dragged cell contains: " + e.DraggedCell.Text)
                                  End Sub
```
