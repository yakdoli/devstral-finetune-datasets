## 5 Frequently Asked Questions

This section discusses specific solutions for very specific tasks. It is organized into various topics based primarily on the control. There are several sections that contain information which is not control specific. In general, if a discussion applies to a specific control like a GridControl or a GridDataBoundGrid, the variable names used in the discussion will reflect that particular control. If the discussion applies to either a GridControl or a GridDataBoundGrid, the generic variable name, grid, will be used.

It comprises the below sections:

### 5.1 GridControl

The GridControl is a cell-oriented grid that can be used in an unbound mode where the GridControl holds the data or in a virtual mode where the data is dynamically provided to the GridControl on demand through certain events. The tasks and solutions discussed in this section are specific to the GridControl.

#### 5.1.1 How to Align Radio Buttons

The Windows Forms Grid control includes support for displaying the radio button of the RadioButton cell type in both vertical and horizontal order.

By default, the RadioButton cell aligns the buttons in horizontal order. The display order can be changed using the RadioButtonAlignment property.

The following code examples illustrate how to invoke the RadioButtonAlignment property.

#### Using C#:

```csharp
this.gridControl1[1, 2].RadioButtonAlignment = ButtonAlignment.Vertical;

this.gridControl1[2, 2].RadioButtonAlignment = ButtonAlignment.Horizontal;
```

#### Using VB.NET:
```vb.net

```
