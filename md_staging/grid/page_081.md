**GridControl Designer** allows users to modify grid properties, such as the `BackColor` and `CellType`, for selected ranges in the grid. The interface includes options for appearance customization, handling of borders, and alignment settings. Additionally, it provides functionality to **save/load XML formatted files** and **SOAP templates**, enhancing the flexibility of grid configuration.

Once the necessary changes are complete, users can simply exit the designer. If modifications have been made, a prompt to save the changes to the **Grid control in the designer** will appear.

### 3.1.4 Lesson 3: Grid Data Bound Grid Designer

#### Overview of Lesson Content

In this lesson, learners will focus on using the **Forms Designer** to create an **Essential Grid Data Bound Grid**. The designer automates most of the coding process, generating necessary code except for two key lines:
1. Filling the **ADO.NET adapter** with data.
2. Updating the database after modifications.

The lesson aims to guide users through the creation of a data-bound grid, leveraging the designerâ€™s capabilities to simplify the implementation process.

#### Topics Covered in This Lesson
- Utilizing the Forms Designer for grid creation.
- Automating code generation for grid setup.
- Handling data binding using ADO.NET.
- Updating database content after grid modifications.

### WinForms-specific conventions
- The **GridControl Designer** allows for visual customization of grid properties such as `BackColor` and `CellAppearance`.
- The property grid for a selected range highlights appearance settings like **LightSteelBlue BackColor** and **Flat CellAppearance**.

#### Images and Elements
- The screenshot in **Figure 47** illustrates the **GridControl Designer interface**, focusing on the **Property Grid for Selected Range** and its associated settings.
- The property grid displays various appearance properties like **Back Color**, **Cell Type**, and **Interior Settings** for the grid cells.

### Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
