- Descriptions of required namespaces and assembly references for proper implementation.

#### Customization
- Configurations for UI elements like column headers, cell styles, and other grid components.
- Instructions for adjusting layout and behavior based on user requirements.

#### Event Handling
- Overview of essential events triggered by user actions, such as cell selection, row edits, and more.
- Guidelines for implementing event handlers to respond to user input and application state changes.

## API Reference (if applicable)
### Namespaces, Classes, and Members
The Essential Grid for Windows Forms provides an extensive set of APIs designed to manage grid functionalities. Below are key components:

- **Namespace:** `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid`
- **Class Main References:**

- `RowColChanged`: Triggered when a grid column or row selection changes.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

Example: Setting up a Simple Grid

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid;

public class MyGridForm : Form
{
    private GridControl myGrid;

    public MyGridForm()
    {
        // Initialize the GridControl
        myGrid = new GridControl();

        // Add rows and columns
        GridRangeInfo myRange = GridRangeInfo.Cells(0, 0, 5, 5);
        myGrid.Model = new GridModel();
        myGrid.Model.RowCount = 5;
        myGrid.Model.ColCount = 5;

        // Populate with sample data
        string[] columnNames = { "Name", "Age", "City" };
        for (int i = 0; i < columnNames.Length; i++)
        {
            myGrid.Model[0, i].CellValue = columnNames[i];
        }

        for (int row = 1; row < 5; row++)
        {
            myGrid.Model[row, 0].CellValue = "User " + (row);
            myGrid.Model[row, 1].CellValue = (50 + row).ToString();
            myGrid.Model[row, 2].CellValue = "Place " + (row);
        }

        // Add to the form
        Controls.Add(myGrid);
    }

    [STAThread]
    static void Main()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);
        Application.Run(new MyGridForm());
    }
}
```
