## Overview
- Demonstrates how to set the height of a row in the GridControl in a Windows Forms application using either the designer or code.
- Details the use of the `RowHeightEntries` collection for designer interaction and the `GridControl.RowHeights` collection for explicit height setting in code.

### 5.1.24 How to Set the Height of a Row

#### Introduction

Changing a row's height is straightforward, whether done via the designer or through code. For designer configuration, utilize the `RowHeightEntries` collection. To explicitly set a specific row's height using code, leverage the `GridControl.RowHeights` collection.

```csharp
public Form1()
{
    // Required for Windows Form Designer support.
    InitializeComponent();

    // TODO: Add any constructor code after InitializeComponent call.

    // Set the number of rows.
    gridControl1.RowCount = 20;

    // Set the number of columns.
    gridControl1.ColCount = 200;
}
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

Public Sub New()
    MyBase.New()

    ' This call is required by the Windows Form Designer.
    InitializeComponent()

    ' Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent() call.

    ' Set the number of rows.
    GridControl1.RowCount = 20

    ' Set the number of columns.
    GridControl1.ColCount = 200

    End Sub
```

### Explanation

The code snippets above demonstrate initializing a `GridControl` in a Windows Forms application, setting up the grid's dimensions by defining the number of rows and columns. This forms the foundational setup where row heights can be manipulated either visually via the designer or programmatically using the `RowHeights` property.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up the GridControl**:
   - Use the `RowCount` property to define the total number of rows in the grid.
   - Use the `ColCount` property to define the total number of columns in the grid.

2. **Adjust Row Heights**:
   - **Using Designer**: In the design surface, right-click the `GridControl` and select properties to access the `RowHeightEntries` collection.
   - **Using Code**: Programmatically set the height of specific rows using the `GridControl.RowHeights` collection.

#### Example of Setting Specific Row Height

Here is an example of explicitly setting the height of a specific row using the `GridControl.RowHeights` property in C#:

```csharp
// Set the height of the 5th row to 40 pixels.
gridControl1.RowHeights[4] = 40;
```

In **VB.NET**, the equivalent would be:

```vb
' Set the height of the 5th row to 40 pixels.
GridControl1.RowHeights(4) = 40
```

### Considerations

- **Performance Implications**: Setting the heights of many rows can impact performance, so consider optimizing if dealing with large datasets.
- **Default Row Height**: Ensure a default row height is set to avoid unintended resizing when heights are not explicitly defined.
