logical is a value or expression that can be evaluated to True or False.

#### 4.1.4.6.6.172 NOW

Returns the serial number of the current date and time.

NOW( )

**Remarks**

- Dates are stored as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1 and January 1, 2008 is serial number 39448 because it is 39,448 days after January 1, 1900.
- Numbers to the right of the decimal point in the serial number represent the time; numbers to the left represent the date. For example, the serial number .5 represents the time 12:00 noon.
