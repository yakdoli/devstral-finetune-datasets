# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Note: GridControl and the GridDataBoundGrid do not support Grouping.

## 1.3.3 Summary

### GridGroupingControl

The GridGroupingControl alone supports calculating summaries. This allows you to display summaries for each group. This enables you to derive additional information from your data such as average, maximum and minimum, summation, count, and so on.

The engine supports summaries that operate on vectors such as Distinct Count, Median, 25% and 75% Quartile. You can also easily add custom summaries.

### Note: For more details, refer to the following section:

**Summaries**

```

### Note: GridControl and the GridDataBoundGrid do not support Summary.

## 1.3.4 Sorting

### GridGroupingControl

The GridGroupingControl provides in-built support for sorting. This allows you to sort the table data against one or more columns. This provides support to sort unlimited number of columns. While sorting, the grid will rearrange the data to match with the current sort criteria. This provides support for multi-column sorting.
