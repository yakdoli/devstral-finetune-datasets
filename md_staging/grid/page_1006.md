# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Guides readers on creating custom summaries by subclassing `SummaryBase`.
- Explains how to define and customize the calculation of summaries using the `CreateSummaryMethod`.
- Demonstrates how to handle summaries for both records and elements other than records.

### Creating Custom Summaries

Custom Summaries can be created by subclassing the `SummaryBase` class and by specifying the `SummaryType` as `Custom`. In the derived class, you can customize the `CreateSummaryMethod` in the way you want. It is the right place where you can define the way how summaries need to be calculated. You can then make this method to be called each time the summary is queried, by assigning the Custom `CreateSummaryDelegate` to the `CreateSummaryMethod` property of the `SummaryDescriptor` inside the `QueryCustomSummary` event handler. Optionally, you can also specify `CreateSummaryFromElementMethod` if summaries need to be calculated also for elements other than records.

### Example

Here is an example that calculates the summaries for both Minimum and Maximum values of the Date field. This can be achieved by using a custom summary field. For Custom summary, the summary Base class is derived and the combine method is made use of to get the new summary value by comparing it with other summary values.

The following code example illustrates how the `Combine` method compares and gets the maximum date value.

#### Code Example: C#

```csharp
public override SummaryBase Combine(SummaryBase other)
{
    return Combine((DateMaxSummary) other);
}

public DateMaxSummary Combine(DateMaxSummary other)
{
    if (Max > other.Max)
        return new DateMaxSummary(this.Max);
    else
        return new DateMaxSummary(other.Max);
}
```

#### Code Example: VB.NET

```vb
Public Overloads Overrides Function Combine(ByVal other As SummaryBase) As SummaryBase
    Return Combine(CType(other, DateMaxSummary))
End Function

Public Overloads Function Combine(ByVal other As DateMaxSummary) As DateMaxSummary
End Function
```

## API Reference
- **Namespace**: (Not specified in the text; may vary based on actual usage)
- **Class**: `SummaryBase`
- **Members**:
  - `SummaryType`: Property to specify the type of summary.
  - `CreateSummaryMethod`: Property to define the custom method for creating summaries.
  - `Combine`: Method to combine summary values, as demonstrated in the example.

## Code Examples
The examples provided illustrate how to:
- Subclass `SummaryBase` to create custom summaries.
- Implement the `Combine` method to calculate the maximum value.
- Handle different summary types (e.g., minimum and maximum) for the Date field.

## Cross References
- Refer to the `SummaryBase` class documentation for detailed information on properties and methods.
- Check the event handling section for guidelines on the `QueryCustomSummary` event.
