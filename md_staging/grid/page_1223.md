# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Instructions on setting row heights in a `GridControl`.
- Explanation on how to set a value into a cell using `GridStyleInfo`.
- Example code snippets provided in both C# and VB.NET.

### WinForms-specific conventions
- Using properties like `RowHeights` and `CellStyleInfo` to customize grid appearance and content.

## Content

### Example

[C#]
```csharp
// Set height of row 3 to 40.
this.gridControl1.RowHeights[3] = 40;

// Set height of header row 30.
this.gridControl1.RowHeights[0] = 30;
```

[VB.NET]
```vbnet
' Set height of row 3 to 40.
Me.GridControl1.RowHeights(3) = 40

' Set height of header row 30.
Me.GridControl1.RowHeights(0) = 30
```

### 5.1.25 How to Set a Value into a Cell

#### Introduction
A style object holds all the information that affects the cells appearance. One property contained in the style object is its CellValue. It is this property that you have to set in order to place a value in a cell. Another property called GridStyleInfo.Text, will allow you to set the value of a cell using a string. Text and CellValue are related properties and setting one of these properties will also set the other.

#### Example
Use a two-parameter indexer (rowIndex, colIndex) on your GridControl object to get a reference to that particular cells style, a GridStyleInfo object.

[C#]
```csharp
// Setting the CellValues of the cell.
int rowIndex = 1;
int colIndex = 2;
gridControl1[rowIndex, colIndex].CellValue = "PI";
rowIndex++;
```

## API Reference (if applicable)

### GridStyleInfo
- **Properties**
  - `CellValue`: The value of the cell as a strongly typed object.
  - `Text`: The text representation of the cell value.

### GridControl
- **Properties**
  - `RowHeights`: An array that defines the height of each row in the grid.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- Demonstrates setting row heights and cell values in both C# and VB.NET.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
- Sections on row height customization and value setting.

## Cross References
