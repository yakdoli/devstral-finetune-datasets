## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
t.Start();
}

private void t_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Timer t = (Timer)sender;
    t.Tick -= new EventHandler(t_Tick);
    t.Dispose();
    this.LogMemoryUsage();
}
```

### VB.NET
```vb.net
AddHandler gridGroupingControl1.PropertyChanging, AddressOf gridGroupingControl1_PropertyChanging

Private t As Timer = Nothing
Private Sub gridGroupingControl1_PropertyChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DescriptorPropertyChangedEventArgs)
    LogWindow.Items.Add(e.ToString())
    If Not t Is Nothing Then
        RemoveHandler t.Tick, AddressOf t_Tick
        t.Dispose()
    End If
    t = New Timer()
    t.Interval = 100
    AddHandler t.Tick, AddressOf t_Tick
    t.Start()
End Sub

Private Sub t_Tick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim t As Timer = CType(sender, Timer)
    RemoveHandler t.Tick, AddressOf t_Tick
    t.Dispose()
    Me.LogMemoryUsage()
End Sub
```

### Optimizations Applied at Different Engine States

1. **Here are the screen shots that show the optimizations applied at different engine states.**
   - Screenshots will demonstrate the performance improvements and optimizations across various engine configurations.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
- The screenshots will provide visual insights into the performance enhancements achieved through the optimizations.

## Cross References
- This section refers to the previous discussions on engine state management and optimization strategies.
