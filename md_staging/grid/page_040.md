## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Overview
- Grid DataBound component designed for data-bound grids.
- Supports flat and hierarchical data sources.
- No grouping, but includes data binding, filtering, sorting, and styling features.
- Integration with Syncfusion's Essential Grid framework.

## Grid DataBound Grid

### Designed for Data-Bound Grids
The Grid DataBound Grid has been designed to be used as a grid that is bound to a data source such as an ADO.NET dataset or data table. It can be used with either flat or hierarchical data sources; does not include grouping support. No data values are stored in a GridDataBoundGrid object. The Grid DataBound Grid is more column-centric than the Grid control as it is data bound. Its GridBoundColumns collection property will maintain an array of GridBoundColumn objects that will hold information like HeaderText, MappingName, and a GridStyleInfo object that holds the style properties for the column.

### Featured Samples
- **Card View Demo**
- **DataBoundGrid Entity Framework**
