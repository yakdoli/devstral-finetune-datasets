# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the GridDataBoundGrid control and its usage.
- Demonstrates binding the GridDataBoundGrid to a data source.
- Explains the process of previewing and running the application with the GridDataBoundGrid.

## Content

### Setting Up GridDataBoundGrid
#### Dragging the GridDataBoundGrid onto the Grid Record Navigation Control

**Figure 414: Grid DataBound Grid dragged from the toolbox onto the Grid Record Navigation Control**

1. Drag and drop the GridDataBoundGrid from the toolbox onto the Grid Record Navigation Control.

#### Setting the DataSource Property

**Step 4:**
**Set the** `GridDataBoundGrid.DataSource` **property to an appropriate object.**

**Figure 415: Data Source set for the Grid DataBound Grid**

- The `GridDataBoundGrid` is bound to a data source, as shown in the figure above.

### Running the Application

**Step 5:**
**Run the application. The following will be the output.**

#### Output
The application runs, and the GridDataBoundGrid displays the desired data based on the configured data source.

## API Reference

### GridDataBoundGrid Properties

- **DataSource**: This property specifies the object that contains the data to be displayed in the GridDataBoundGrid. Its type is `object`.

## Code Examples

The following example demonstrates setting up a GridDataBoundGrid and binding it to a data source:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid;

// Sample implementation
public class MyGridForm : Form
{
    private GridDataBoundGrid gridDataBoundGrid1;

    public MyGridForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void InitializeComponent()
    {
        gridDataBoundGrid1 = new GridDataBoundGrid();

        // Dock the GridDataBoundGrid to the form
        gridDataBoundGrid1.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;

        // Assuming 'myDataSource' is defined and populated
        gridDataBoundGrid1.DataSource = myDataSource;

        this.Controls.Add(gridDataBoundGrid1);
    }
}
```
