# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Discusses issues related to dispatching windows messages to controls during Batch Update operations.
- Explains the problem that arises when Application.DoEvents is triggered inside BeginUpdate() and EndUpdate() methods.
- Provides solutions to handle the infinite loop caused by WM_PAINT message handling during batch updates.

### The Problem with Application.DoEvents in Batch Updates

#### Overview
The problem arises when users attempt to dispatch windows messages to controls (triggering the Application.DoEvents) inside the BeginUpdate() and EndUpdate() methods.

#### Root Cause
The root cause of the problem is that the usage of Application.DoEvents asks the WM_PAINT messages of the Grid to execute. However, the WM_PAINT messages are ignored because the grid is in an updating state. The WM_PAINT message is only processed by the Grid when EndUpdate is called. This results in an **infinite loop execution**, as the loop will never return from WM_PAINT.

### Resolving the Problem

The above problem can be resolved in the following two ways:

#### Solution 1
If the usage of Application.DoEvents is mandatory, the simplest way to get rid of this problem is by calling the grid.CancelUpdate before triggering Application.DoEvents. After that, the grid can be updated with the call to Grid.BeginUpdate.

#### Solution 2
Add a public static member to the class where Application.DoEvents is to be used. Then override the Grid's WndProc method and process the WM_PAINT if the DoEvents loop is triggered.

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
public static bool InDoEvents = false;
private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    this.gridControl1.BeginUpdate();
    this.gridControl1.Refresh();

    Console.WriteLine("before Application.DoEvents");
    Form1.InDoEvents = true;
    Application.DoEvents();
    Form1.InDoEvents = false;
    Console.WriteLine("after Application.DoEvents");

    this.gridControl1.EndUpdate();
}

public class MyGridControl : GridControl
{
    public const int WM_PAINT = 15;
    protected override void WndProc(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message msg)
    {
        if (Form1.InDoEvents && msg.Msg == WM_PAINT)
            DefWndProc(ref msg);
        else
            base.WndProc(ref msg);
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### Methods
- `BeginUpdate()`: Initiates batch update mode for the GridControl.
- `EndUpdate()`: Ends batch update mode for the GridControl.
- `CancelUpdate()`: Cancels any pending updates.
- `WndProc(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message msg)`: Processes messages sent to the GridControl.

### Public Constants
- `WM_PAINT = 15`: Constant representing the WM_PAINT message.

## Code Examples

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to handle the issue of infinite loops caused by WM_PAINT messages during batch updates in a Windows Forms application. It includes the implementation of the grid control and the custom handling of the WM_PAINT message when Application.DoEvents is used.
