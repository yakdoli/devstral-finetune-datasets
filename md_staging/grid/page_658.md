## Overview
- Demonstrates example code snippets for manipulating a table in the Essential Grid for Windows Forms.
- Includes VB.NET code for updating rows by modification, insertion, or removal using a timer tick event.
- Focuses on dynamically updating the grid data while managing user interaction efficiently.

## Content

The following example illustrates how to dynamically update a table using a timer and perform row operations such as updating, inserting, or removing records based on certain conditions.

### VB.NET Code Example

```vb
Private skipTimer As Boolean = False

Private Sub timer_Tick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    If skipTimer Then
        Return
    End If

    timerCount += 1

    Try
        Dim i As Integer = 0
        Do While i < m_numUpdatesPerTick

            ' Application.DoEvents();
            Dim recNum As Integer = rand.Next(table.Rows.Count - 1)
            Dim rowNum As Integer = recNum + 1
            Dim col As Integer = rand.Next(16) + 1
            Dim colNum As Integer = col + 1
            Dim drow As DataRow = table.Rows(recNum)
            If Not (TypeOf drow(col) Is DBNull) Then
                drow(col) = CInt(Convert.ToDouble(drow(col)) * (rand.Next(50) / 100.0f + 0.8))
            End If
            i += 1
        Loop

        ' Insert or remove a row.
        If insertRemoveCount = 0 Then
            Return
        End If

        If toggleInsertRemove > 0 AndAlso (timerCount Mod insertRemoveModulus) = 0 Then
            ' Logic for inserting or removing a row goes here.
        End If
    Catch ex As Exception
        ' Handle exceptions appropriately.
    End Try
End Sub
```

### Explanation
- **`skipTimer`**: A flag to control whether the timer logic should be executed.
- **`timerCount`**: Increments with each tick to track the number of ticks.
- **Random Operations**: Updates grid data by modifying existing rows. The operations involve selecting random rows and columns for updates.
- **Insert/Remove Logic**: Conditions to decide whether to insert or remove a row based on the `toggleInsertRemove` and `insertRemoveCount` values.

This code snippet showcases a comprehensive approach to dynamically managing grid data in a Windows Forms application using a timer event.

### Related API

- **`table.Rows.RemoveAt(recNum)`**: Removes a specified row from the table.
- **`rand.Next()`**: Generates random numbers for selecting rows and columns.
- **`Application.DoEvents()`**: Ensures that the application processes it's messages, which is useful for updating UI in a timely manner.
