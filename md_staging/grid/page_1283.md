# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
    {
        for (int i = range.Top; i <= range.Bottom; ++i)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Row {0} selected", i));
        }
    }
```

## [VB]

```vb
    Dim ranges As GridRangeInfoList = Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.Selections.GetSelectedRows(True, False)

    For Each range As GridRangeInfo In ranges
        For i As Integer = range.Top To range.Bottom
            Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Row {0} selected", i))
        Next i
    Next range
```

## 5.2.27 How to Get Selected Ranges in GridDataBoundGrid

To get the selected range of cells, use the `GetSelectedRanges` method. It returns the list with selected cells. This method has two arguments:

- `ranges` - It gets the range of cells to be selected.
- `ConsiderCurrentCell`
  - True - If current cell should be treated as selected range.

## API Reference (if applicable)

  - **Returns**: `GridRangeInfoList` - A list containing the selected ranges.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

### C#

```csharp
GridRangeInfoList selectedRanges = gridDataBoundGrid1.Selections.GetSelectedRanges(true, true);
foreach (GridRangeInfo range in selectedRanges)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Selected Range: " + range.ToString());
}
```

### VB

```vb
Dim selectedRanges As GridRangeInfoList = Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.Selections.GetSelectedRanges(True, True)
For Each range As GridRangeInfo In selectedRanges
    Console.WriteLine("Selected Range: " + range.ToString())
Next range
```
