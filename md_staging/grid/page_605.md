## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Overview
- This page highlights features of the Grid Grouping Control in Windows Forms, focusing on "Frozen Columns" and "Stacked MultiHeaders."

- **Key Features**:
  - The parent columns labeled "parentID" and "ParentName" are frozen, ensuring visibility regardless of scrolling.
  - The child table, "MyChildTable," is displayed with its own columns, further illustrating the use of nested data structures.

#### Stacked MultiHeaders: 
This feature allows you to create additional header rows that span across visible grid columns. You can group the columns under each header row. It also supports drag/drop of these header rows.
