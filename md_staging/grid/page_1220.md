## Overview

- This page provides instructions on saving and sharing the contents of a Grid in memory without writing to a file system.
- It demonstrates how to set cell properties for a range of cells.

## Content

### 5.1.21 How to save the contents of a Grid in memory rather than a file system to export to another grid

#### Note:

Depending upon exactly what object is stored in the `CellValue` property, you may have to do additional work to retrieve a usable value from the style. There is also a `FormattedText` property that may give you a different value. One example would be if the cell is a combobox cell type that is using the `DisplayMember` and `ValueMember` properties to show different values from the ones being stored in the `GridControl` (as in foreign key look tables). In this case, the `Text` property is the `ValueMember` value and the `FormattedText` property is the `DisplayMember` property.

#### Explanation

You can save the contents of a grid in memory rather than writing to a file system. This can be done using the `SaveSoap` or `SaveBinary` method of `GridControl`. The below code snippet illustrates how this can be done.

```csharp
[C#]

MemoryStream s = new MemoryStream();
gridControl1.Model.SaveSoap(s);  // or gridControl1.Model.SaveBinary(s);
s.Position = 0;
gridControl1.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s);
gridControl2.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s);
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

Dim s As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream()
gridControl1.Model.SaveSoap(s)  ' or gridControl1.Model.SaveBinary(s);
s.Position = 0
gridControl1.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s)
gridControl2.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s)
```

### 5.1.22 How to Set the Cell Properties for a Range of Cells

#### Introduction

This section discusses how to set cell properties for a range of cells in a GridControl.

### API Reference

#### Methods

- `SaveSoap`
- `SaveBinary`
- `LoadSoap`

#### Properties

- `CellValue`
- `Text`
- `FormattedText`
- `DisplayMember`
- `ValueMember`

### Code Examples

#### C#

```csharp
// Saving and loading grid contents using SaveSoap
MemoryStream s = new MemoryStream();
gridControl1.Model.SaveSoap(s);
s.Position = 0;
gridControl2.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
' Saving and loading grid contents using SaveSoap
Dim s As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream()
gridControl1.Model.SaveSoap(s)
s.Position = 0
gridControl2.Model = GridModel.LoadSoap(s)
```

### Summary

This section provides methods and examples to save and share the contents of a GridControl in memory, avoiding file system operations. It also sets the stage for setting cell properties for a range of cells.
