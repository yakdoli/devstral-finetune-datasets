# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Provides functionality for calculating average deviation and various average (arithmetic mean) using different methods.
- Covers the use of functions such as AVEDEV, AVERAGE, and AVERAGEA with detailed explanations and syntax.

## Content

### AVEDEV Function

#### Syntax
```plaintext
AVEDEV(number1, number2, ...)
```
Where:
- `number1, number2, ...` are arguments for which you want the average of the absolute deviations. You can also use a single array or a reference to an array instead of arguments separated by commas.

#### Remarks
- The arguments must either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with a zero value are included.
- The equation for average deviation is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{n} \sum |x - \bar{x}|
  \]
  where \( \bar{x} \) is the arithmetic mean of the data.

### AVERAGE Function

#### Syntax
```plaintext
AVERAGE(number1, number2, ...)
```
Where:
- `number1, number2, ...` are numeric arguments for which you want the average.

#### Remarks
- The arguments must either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with a zero value are included.

### AVERAGEA Function

#### Syntax
```plaintext
AVERAGEA(number1, number2, ...)
```
Where:
- Calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of the values in the list of arguments. In addition to numbers and text, logical values such as True and False are also included in the calculation.
