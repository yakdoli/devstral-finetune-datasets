#### Find and Replace Feature

The "Grid Find and Replace Demo" shows the Find and Replace functionality within the Essential Grid. Users can specify a value to search for and replace with, with options to match case, search whole cells, and search upwards. The grid highlights the occurrences of the search term, allowing the user to find and replace values efficiently.

### 4.1.4.5.8 Unhide Column by Double-Clicking Disabled

Essential Grid has modified the unhide column operation to mimic the behavior seen in Microsoft Excel. Prior to this change, hidden columns could be revealed by double-clicking a row. This functionality has now been disabled, ensuring that applications built using Essential Grid will have a hide/unhide behavior consistent with Microsoft Excel.
