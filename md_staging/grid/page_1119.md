# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

This topic elaborates on filtering columns in the Grid Data Bound Grid and Grid Grouping controls by their display member.

## Filtering Columns in Grid Data Bound Grid

The GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt class provides support to filter a column in the Grid Data Bound Grid by its display member instead of the value member. This is accomplished by implementing a custom filter bar cell by replacing the default filter bar cell.

### Code Example in C#

Following code example illustrates how to wire the GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt to the Grid Data Bound Grid.

```csharp
[C#]

private GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt filterBar;
filterBar = new GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt ();
filterBar.WireGrid(this.gridDataBoundGrid1);
```

### Code Example in VB.NET

```vb
[VB.NET]

Private filterBar As GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt
filterBar = New GridDataBoundGridFilterBarExt()
filterBar.WireGrid(Me.gridDataBoundGrid1)
```

### Visual Illustration
