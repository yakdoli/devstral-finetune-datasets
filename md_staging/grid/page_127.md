| (o) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user speech shall be provided, or support for Assistive Technology used by people with disabilities shall be provided. | Fully Supported                         | Fully Supported          | Can be achieved through existing cell-related APIs without requiring user speech.                                |
| (p) At least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require fine motor control or simultaneous actions, and that is operable with limited reach and                       | Fully Supported                         | Essential Grid controls provide functionality that conform to the criteria. | Can be achieved through existing cell-related APIs.                                                         |
