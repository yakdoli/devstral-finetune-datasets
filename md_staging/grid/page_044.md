# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

This section will step you through the conversion of Grid content to an Excel file, and also discusses the various converter options.

- **Accessibility Information for Grid Windows Forms**

This section will detail the criteria for accessibility for Grid Windows Forms.

## 3.1.1 Before You Begin

Some of the projects in this tutorial are mainly VS .NET steps, but we have included them to give you complete experience and information.

During the installation of Essential Grid, these controls will be installed in your toolbox within Visual Studio: Grid control, Grid Data Bound Grid, Grid List control, Grid Record Navigation control, and Grid Grouping control. The latter control will only be available if you have purchased the Enterprise version of Essential Grid. If these controls are not available in your toolbox, you must add them before proceeding with this tutorial.

Lesson 1 assumes the sample data file, `ACC.mdb`, that we ship as part of our samples, is on your disk. It is usually found in this folder: `C:\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\[Version Number]\Windows\Data`

Lesson 2 assumes that you have previously installed the QuickStart samples that are part of the .NET framework installation. In particular, we will use the NorthWind MSDE database that is part of those samples.

Depending on the specifications of your computer (resolution, color, size of monitor), the illustrations and code in this tutorial may vary slightly from what will appear on your screen. Contact technical support if you have any questions.
