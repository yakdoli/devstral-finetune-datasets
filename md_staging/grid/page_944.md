## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Overview

This section discusses the process of restoring the Grid Schema by deserialization, showcasing the capabilities of the Essential Grid control in Windows Forms. The interface includes features for serializing and deserializing(Grid data) as well as resetting the grid to its default state.

### Content

#### Restoring the Grid Schema by Deserialization

The image shows a Windows Form with an grid interface titled **CategoryView...**. The grid contains three columns: **CategoryID**, **CategoryName**, and **Description**. The rows are as follows:

- **CategoryID**: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **CategoryName**: "Beverages", "Condiments", "Confections", "Dairy Products"
- **Description**: Various descriptions for each category are listed.

Below the grid, there are three buttons labeled **Serialize**, **Deserialize**, and **Reset**.

#### Saving / Restoring Look and Feel Properties

You can save, look and feel properties in XML format. This will allow you to design a basic look and feel to use with all your Grid Grouping controls and then easily apply this look and feel to new grids at design-time or run-time.

**It can be done in the following ways:**

- Through Verbs

## API Reference

This section provides information on how to use and manipulate the look and feel properties of the Grid control using various methods and settings.

### Serializing and Deserializing Grid Properties

To save the look and feel properties of the grid, you can use serialization techniques such as XML serialization. This involves converting the grid's settings into XML format, which can then be stored and later retrieved to restore those settings.

### Resetting Properties

The **Reset** button in the grid interface allows you to restore the grid to its default state.

## Code Examples

Below is a conceptual code snippet that demonstrates how you can save and restore the look and feel properties of the Grid control using XML serialization:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Grid;
using System.Xml;

// Serialize the Grid properties
GridControl grid = new GridControl();
using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("GridSettings.xml"))
{
    grid.Serialize(writer.BaseStream);
}

// Deserialize the Grid properties
using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("GridSettings.xml"))
{
    grid.Deserialize(reader.BaseStream);
}
```
