## Overview
- This page describes the functionality of dragging and filling series in an Excel-like interface in `Essential Grid for Windows Forms`.
- It explains the `MouseMove` and `MouseUp` handlers that enable drag-and-fill operations.
- The feature is illustrated with screenshots showing a selected series during drag and fill operations.

## Content

### Drag and Fill Series

The following methods are used to implement drag-and-fill functionality:

- **MouseMove**: The code in this method allows dragging the series in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), while maintaining a rectangular layout.
- **MouseUp**: The code in this method updates the cell values based on the dragged series content (whether it is a formula, text, or numeric value).

### Screenshot Illustrations
