### 5.4.15 How to Get the Selected Ranges in a Grid

#### Introduction
The grid.Selections.Ranges is a GridRangeInfoList object which holds the currently selected ranges.

#### Example
You can iterate through this list retrieving GridRangeInfo objects with code such as.

```csharp
// Iterate through the SelectionRanges, to display every range in the list.
foreach (GridRangeInfo range in this.grid.Selections.Ranges)
{
    MessageBox.Show(range.ToString());
}
```

```vbnet
Dim range As GridRangeInfo

' Iterate through the SelectionRanges, to display every range in the list.
For Each range In Me.grid.Selections.Ranges
    MessageBox.Show(range.ToString())
Next
```

In the previous code, note that the GridRangeInfo object is not really being used for anything. When you actually try to use it, you will need to take into account the fact that you cannot make any assumptions regarding whether this range object is a row range or a cell range or a column range or something else. For example, you may want to make use of Range.Top and Range.Bottom to get the top and bottom rows that have been selected. But, if the range happens to be a column range, then these properties will not be valid as column ranges.

So, before using such range properties, you must check whether these properties have been properly set. The GridRangeInfo class has a method that can manage this task: `GridRangeInfo.ExpandRange`. If you need to access properties like left, right, top and bottom in a GridRangeInfo where it is unknown whether or not the range is a cell range, then you should first call `ExpandRange` to make sure that this is the case.
