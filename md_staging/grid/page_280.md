# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## DEVSQ

Returns the sum of squares of deviations of data points from their sample mean.

### Syntax

`DEVSQ(number1, number2, ...)`, where:

- `number1, number2, ...` are arguments for which you want to calculate the sum of squared deviations. You can also use a single array or a reference to an array instead of arguments separated by commas.

### Remarks

- The arguments must be numbers or names, arrays or references that contain numbers.
- The equation for the sum of squared deviations is,

\[
DEVSQ = \sum (x - \bar{x})^2
\]

## DGET

The DGET function extracts a single value from a column of a list or database which matches the conditions that have been specified.

### Syntax

`DGET(database, field, criteria)` where:

- `database` is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
- `field` indicates which column is used in the function.
- `criteria` is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.

## Disc

The Disc function returns the discount rate for a security.

### Syntax

`Disc(Arg1, Arg2, Arg3, Arg4, Arg5)` where:

- `Arg1` represents the security's settlement date.
- `Arg2` represents the security's maturity date.
- `Arg3` represents the security's price per $100 face value.
- `Arg4` represents the security's redemption value.
- `Arg5` represents the type of day count basis to use.
