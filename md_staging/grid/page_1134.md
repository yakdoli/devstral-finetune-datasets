# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## 4.7.11 Fill Series

### Support to implement Excel-like Fill Series in the Grid

A helper class implementing IMouseController interface has been added to GridHelperClasses library to implement Excel-like Fill Series in the Grid.

To make use of this functionality, Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.Windows.dll must be referred and the mouse controller has to be added in MouseControllerDispatcher of grid.

The following support has been provided since 8.2

The behavior has extended support which pops up a menu after the drag that has two items:
- Copy Series - Copy paste the content from the cell.
- Fill Series - Fill the cell with appropriate sequence.

The Excel Like fill Series has support on:
- Number - From active range with single or multiple cells (e.g. 1, 2, 3...)
- Text - Will paste the same text for both 'copy series' and 'fill series'
- Date - Date format must be MM/DD/YYYY
- Month - The month in text (e.g. January, February, March... or Jan, Feb, Mar...)

The following code illustrates how to add Excel Like fill Series.

#### Code Examples

- **C#**
  ```csharp
  gridControl1.ExcelLikeCurrentCell = true;
  Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.ExcelSelectionMarkerMouseController marker = new Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.ExcelSelectionMarkerMouseController(this.gridControl1);
  this.gridControl1.MouseControllerDispatcher.Add(marker);
  ```

- **VB**
  ```vb
  GridControl1.ExcelLikeCurrentCell = True
  Dim excelMarker As New ExcelMarkerMouseController(GridControl)
  GridControl1.MouseControllerDispatcher.Add(excelMarker)
  ```
