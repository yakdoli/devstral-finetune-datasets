## 5.4.33 How to Select All Text in a Grid After Clicking a Cell

### Introduction

The `ActivateCurrentCellBehavior` property controls the activation behavior as a cell becomes current by being clicked or through the cursor keys. If you want the cell text to be fully selected when a cell becomes the current cell, then use the following property.

The following code illustrates how to set the Cell Activation behavior to `SelectAll` in `GridControl`:

#### C#

```csharp
// Set Cell Activation behavior to 'SelectAll'.
this.gridControl1.ActivateCurrentCellBehavior =
GridCellActivateAction.SelectAll;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' Set Cell Activation behavior to 'SelectAll'.
Me.Grid.ActivateCurrentCellBehavior = GridCellActivateAction.SelectAll
```
