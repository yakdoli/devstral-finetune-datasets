### How to Get New Form Window in Front of an Active Window while Double Clicking a Cell

#### Content

##### 5.3.1.16 How to Get New Form Window in Front of an Active Window while Double Clicking a Cell

To display a new form window while double-clicking a cell, the `TableControlCellDoubleClick` event is handled. The `window.BringToFront()` method is used to bring the new window in front of the active window, but this is effective only if the `FocusOnMouseDown` property is set to `false`.

##### Implementation Example

```csharp
//Form load...
gridGroupingControl1.TableControlCellDoubleClick += 
    gridGroupingControl1OnTableControlCellDoubleClick;
gridGroupingControl1.TableOptions.ListBoxSelectionMode = SelectionMode.One;
```

## API Reference

### Event: `TableControlCellDoubleClick`

#### Description
This event is triggered when a cell in the grid is double-clicked.

### Property: `FocusOnMouseDown`

#### Description
Determines whether focus should be set on mouse down. Setting this to `false` is necessary for the `window.BringToFront()` method to work effectively.

### Method: `window.BringToFront()`

#### Description
Brought the form window to the front of the active window.

### Property: `ListBoxSelectionMode`

#### Description
Specifies the mode in which items in the grid's list box are selected.

## Code Examples

### C#

```csharp
gridGroupingControl1.TableControlCellDoubleClick += 
    gridGroupingControl1OnTableControlCellDoubleClick;

gridGroupingControl1.TableOptions.ListBoxSelectionMode = SelectionMode.One;
```
