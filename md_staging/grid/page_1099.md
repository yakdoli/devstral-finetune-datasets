**Apply Filter Only on Lost Focus in GridDynamicFilter**

ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus property enables you to turn off/on the filtering on each key stroke in GridDynamicFilter.

Set ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus property to true to filter only when the filter cell lost focus. This disables filtering for each key stroke including Enter, arrow keys, and tab keys.

Defaults value is false and allows filtering for each key stroke.

The following code illustrates how to add ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus property.

```csharp
GridDynamicFilter filter = new GridDynamicFilter();
filter.ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus = true;
```

when the code runs, the following output displays.

## Related Information

### Notes
- The ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus property is useful when you want to avoid immediate filtering during each keystroke, optimizing performance or user experience.

### Example
To apply this property in your application:

```csharp
GridDynamicFilter filter = new GridDynamicFilter();
filter.ApplyFilterOnlyOnCellLostFocus = true;
```

This setting ensures that the filter only updates when the focus leaves the filter cell, rather than on every keystroke.
