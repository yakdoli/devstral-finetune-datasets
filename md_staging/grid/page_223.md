## Overview

- Demonstrates the use of an interactive chart cell in the Essential Grid for Windows Forms.
- Explains how to create and display drop-down grids within grid cells using custom cell models and renderers.
- Includes code examples in C# for implementing drop-down grid functionality.

## Content

### Chart Cell

The chart cell in the grid is displayed with data from the "Chart Data" section. Below is the chart data and the corresponding bar chart:

#### Chart Data

| Data  | Team1 | Team2 | Team3 | Team4 |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Data1 | 35    | 24    | 43    | 51    |
| Data2 | 41    | 32    | 48    | 49    |
| Data3 | 27    | 21    | 15    | 16    |

#### Bar Chart

The bar chart visually represents the data from the table, with each team's data series displayed in different colors.

This chart is interactive, and changes to the "ChartData" will reflect in the chart display.

### Drop-Down Grid Cell

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Essential Grid allows for the display of drop-down grids in cells using a custom cell model and renderer.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses a custom cell derived from the `GridDropDownGridCellModel/GridDropDownGridCellRenderer` classes.
  - The `GridDropDownGridCellModel` gets an instance of the `GridControlBase`, which is then displayed through the `GridDropDownGridCellRenderer`.

#### Actions and Code Examples

The actions mentioned can be performed by using the following code examples.

#### Code Examples
