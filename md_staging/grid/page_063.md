### Figure 26: Grouping by the CompanyName Column

The image illustrates the Essential Grid control, specifically focusing on the functionality of grouping data by the `Companyname` column. It shows a grid titled "Suppliers" with data organized into various columns such as `Address`, `City`, and `Companyname`. The grid indicates that there are 29 items in total.

#### Key Observations:
- The grid is structured to display supplier information, including their addresses and cities.
- Each company name group (e.g., "Exotic Liquids," "Grandma Kelly's Homestead") appears to be individually collapsed, as indicated by the absence of a "+" or "-" symbol next to each group.
- The note clarifies that:
  - Each set of grouped values has its own "Caption" row and its own "AddNew" row (`+`).
  - Each group has its own PlusMinus cell to expand or collapse the group.
