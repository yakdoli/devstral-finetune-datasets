# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The document describes the architectural flow and use case scenarios for performing Coded UI Tests with Essential Grid for Windows Forms.
- It covers steps to deploy the extension assembly, prepare sample applications, write tests using VS 2010, and test the application with generated Coded UI Tests.

## Content

### Figures and Architecture

#### Figure 472: Architectural Diagram
- **Grid Test Plugin**  
  Implements the necessary details to communicate with the VS 2010 Test Framework.
- **VS2010 Test Framework**  
  Facilitates communication between the Grid application and the test plugin.
- **Grid Application**  
  Runs with a .NET Remoting channel to channel data across the VS 2010 Test Framework, identifying Cells and Grid controls.

### Key Features
- The Grid Test Plugin interfaces with the VS 2010 Test Framework to enable integration of testing frameworks.
- The .NET Remoting channel ensures smooth communication between the Grid application host and the Grid Test Plugin.
- The data flow channels across the VS 2010 Test Framework to identify Grid elements.

### Use Case Scenarios

#### Creating a Coded UI Test
You can create a Coded UI Test with Essential Grid for Windows Forms. The following example shows the implementation of the feature.

#### Steps to Create a Coded UI Test Project
Perform the following initial steps before creating the Coded UI Test project:
1. Deploying Extension assembly  
2. Prepare the Grid sample application  
3. Write UI tests using VS 2010  
4. Testing the application with generated Coded UI Tests  

### Deploying Extension Assembly

#### Subsection: 4.11.1 Deploying Extension Assembly

To deploy the extension assembly:
1. Navigate to the `copydrop.bat` file in the UITest folder.
2. Run the `Bat` file to place the Extension and Provider assemblies with appropriate directories, allowing VS2010 to pick them up.
