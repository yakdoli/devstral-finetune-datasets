![Figure 457](#)

The image shows a Syncfusion Grid window with a pop-up menu displayed after dragging a cell. The menu contains options to "Copy Series" and "Fill Series." The cell labeled "January" in column C row 4 is highlighted, indicating the cell being dragged.

#### Note
The cell has been dragged exactly the same as it is done in Excel.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation
1. The user drags the cell containing "January" (cell C4) across the grid.
2. Upon dragging, a pop-up menu appears with the options:
   - **Copy Series**: Copies the series without filling.
   - **Fill Series**: Fills the series as per the user's selection.
3. The image shows the result after the "Fill Series" has been selected from the pop-up menu.
