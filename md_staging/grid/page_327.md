# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

When cumulative = True, the formula is the integral from negative infinity to x of the given formula.

- #VALUE! - occurs if mean is non-numeric.
- #VALUE! - occurs if standard\_dev is non-numeric.
- #NUM! - occurs if standard\_dev is equal to or less than zero.

## NormsDist

The NormsDist function returns the probability that the observed value of a standard normal random variable will be less than or equal to the parameter.

### Syntax:

`NormsDist(value)`

where:

`value` is a numeric value that checks with the random variable.

## NORMINV

Returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation.

### Syntax

`NORMINV(probability, mean, standard_dev)`, where:

`NORM.INV(probability, mean, standard_dev)` where:

- probability is a probability that corresponds to the normal distribution.
- mean is the arithmetic mean of the distribution.
- standard_dev is the standard deviation of the distribution.

### Remarks:

- #NUM! - if probability is equal to or less than zero.
- #NUM! - if probability is equal to or greater than 1.
- #VALUE! - if probability is non-numeric.
- #VALUE! - if mean is non-numeric.
- #NUM! - if standard\_dev is equal to or less than zero.
