- Explains the functionality of the RecordNavigationBar for moving between records.
- Introduces the Grid Aware Text Box class for editing grid cells.

### Navigation Methods
The following code snippets illustrate the use of navigation methods to move between records in a grid using the `RecordNavigationBar`:

```csharp
Me.gridGroupingControl1.RecordNavigationBar.MoveNext()
// This method is used to navigate the previous record
Me.gridGroupingControl1.RecordNavigationBar.MovePrevious()
```

### Navigation Bar Demonstration
The image below shows a navigation bar in action, providing buttons to navigate between records within a grid.

### 4.6 Grid Aware Text Box

This class is derived from the textbox and allows you to bind it to the `CurrentCell` of either a Grid control or a Grid Data Bound Grid. The standard use for such a text box is to provide a special edit bar for editing grid cells. This is similar to the FormulaBar in Excel. In Essential Grid's Formula Grid sample, a similar Formula Bar is implemented by using a Grid Aware Text Box.
