### Grouping Grid Example

#### User Interface
The image represents a grouping grid feature in the Essential Grid for Windows Forms, demonstrating a structured and visually organized table.

#### Key Components:
- **ParentTable**: Indicates the main table being grouped.
- **GroupID**: A field used to categorize and group records.
- **MyChildTable**: A child table used alongside the ParentTable for additional data reference.
- **Drag functionality**: The user interface allows dragging column headers to group records by that specific column.

#### Data Presentation:
The grid contains the following columns:
- **ParentID**: Unique identifier for parent records.
- **ParentName**: Name associated with each parent record.
- **GroupID**: Field used for grouping records.

#### Grouped Records:
- **GroupID: 100 - 2 Items**
  - Contains two records: 
    - **Record 1**: `ParentID: 1`, `ParentName: parentName1`
    - **Record 2**: `ParentID: 6`, `ParentName: parentName6`
- **GroupID: 101 - 4 Items**
- **GroupID: 102 - 6 Items**

Each group is expandable to view the individual records within it, providing an interactive and hierarchical view of the data.

### Interactive Overview:
- The grid allows users to expand and collapse groups to navigate through the hierarchy.
- Group summaries, such as the number of items in each group, are displayed in a summary row.

#### Example Notes:
- Preview notes are added above specific grouped records (e.g., "Preview notes for Record (parentID: 1)").
- Group notes can preview information for the entire group (e.g., "Preview notes for Group (GroupID: 102)").
