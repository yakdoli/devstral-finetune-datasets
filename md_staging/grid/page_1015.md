# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Code for implementing filter operations and handling user interactions in a WinForms application.

## Content

### Code for Filtering Operations
The following code demonstrates how to handle different filter conditions and closes the dialog when the Cancel button is clicked.

```vb
s = " <= '" + text + "'"
End Select
Return s
End Function

' Code that is implemented on clicking the Cancel button.
Private Sub button2_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Me.Close()
End Sub
```

### Designing a Custom Filter Dialog
After designing a filter dialog, the next step is to create the required model and renderer classes to adopt the custom filter dialog. Inside the renderer, override the necessary methods to style or customize the appearance and behavior of the dialog.

## API Reference
- **Classes, Methods, and Properties Involved**:
  - `s` - The string containing the filter condition.
  - `text` - The user input for filtering.
  - `button2_Click` - Event handler for the Cancel button click.

## Code Examples
The provided code examples demonstrate:
- Creating a filter condition dynamically based on user input.
- Handling the closing of the dialog when the user clicks the Cancel button.
