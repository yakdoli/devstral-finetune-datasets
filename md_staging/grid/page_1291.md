# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes how to handle the `CurrentCellKeyDown` event to select cell contents using the F2 key.
- Addresses the resolution of the "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" error in `GridDataBoundGrid` Designer.

## Content

### Handling Key Events for Cell Selection
If the contents have to be selected using the F2 key, the `CurrentCellKeyDown` event can be handled, and the contents can be selected.

#### Sample code

**[C#]**
```csharp
private void gridControl_CurrentCellKeyDown(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.KeyCode == Keys.F2)
    {
        ((GridTextBoxCellRenderer)this.gridControl1.CurrentCell.Renderer).TextBox.SelectAll();
    }
}
```

**[VB]**
```vb
Private Sub gridControl1_CurrentCellKeyDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs)
    If e.KeyCode = Keys.F2 Then
        CType(Me.gridControl1.CurrentCell.Renderer, GridTextBoxCellRenderer).TextBox.SelectAll()
    End If
End Sub
```

### Resolving "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" Error

#### 5.2.32 How to resolve the “Object reference not set to an instance of an object” error generation in GridDataBoundGrid Designer

The GridDataBoundGrid is a grid that is bound to data sources such as Data Tables, String Collections, Data Sets, and Data Views. The Hidden, Position, and Width properties of GridDataBoundColumn generate the "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" error on designer code generation. This issue has been resolved for version 10.1.0.44 and following versions by setting the `DesignerSerializationVisibility` for these codes to `Hidden`.
