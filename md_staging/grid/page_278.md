# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview

- The DB function calculates depreciation based on the formula: 
  \[
  (\text{cost} - \text{total depreciation from prior periods}) * \text{rate} * \frac{(12 - \text{month})}{12}.
  \]
- The `DCOUNT` function counts the number of cells containing numbers in a column of a list or database that matches specified conditions.
- The `DCOUNTA` function counts the number of nonblank cells in a column of a list or database that matches specified conditions.
- The `DDB` function returns the depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the double-declining balance method or a custom method.

## Content

### Depreciation Calculation Formula

For the last period, DB uses the following formula:

\[
(\text{cost} - \text{total depreciation from prior periods}) * \text{rate} * \frac{(12 - \text{month})}{12}
\]

### 4.1.4.6.6.61 DCOUNT

The `DCOUNT` function counts the number of cells that contain numbers in a column of a list or database which matches the conditions that are been specified.

**Syntax:**
- `DCOUNT(database, field, criteria)` where:
  - **database** is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
  - **field** indicates which column is used in the function.
  - **criteria** is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.

### 4.1.4.6.6.62 DCOUNTA

The `DCOUNTA` function counts the number of nonblank cells in a column of a list or database that matches the conditions that have been specified.

**Syntax:**
- `DCOUNTA(database, field, criteria)` where:
  - **database** is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
  - **field** indicates which column is used in the function.
  - **criteria** is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.

### 4.1.4.6.6.63 DDB

The `DDB` function returns the depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the double-declining balance method or some other method you specify.

**Syntax:**
- `DDB(cost, salvage, life, period, factor)` where:
  - **cost** is the initial cost of the asset.
  - **salvage** is the value at the end of the depreciation (sometimes called the salvage value of the asset).
  - **life** is the number of periods over which the asset is being depreciated (sometimes called the useful life of the asset).

## API Reference (if applicable)

This section can be expanded with specific function implementations or examples if required.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

This section can include code snippets demonstrating the usage of the above functions.

```csharp
// Example of using DDB function
double cost = 100000;
double salvage = 1000;
int life = 5;
int period = 2;
double factor = 2;

double depreciation = DDB(cost, salvage, life, period, factor);
Console.WriteLine(depreciation);
```
