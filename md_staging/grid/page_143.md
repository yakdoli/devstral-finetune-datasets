### 4.1.3.3 Data Binding

Essential Grid comes with a control to meet the user requirements such as a grid which is bound to an ADO.NET data source, or a grid that is virtually bound to the arbitrary collections, or a grid that maintains its own data storage. Following table lists the Data Binding features supported by the Grid control.
