### Features within a Grid

- **Add New Record Section**: This is the section within a group that is shown above the table records and/or below the records for each group. It implements logic to add new records.
- **Preview Section**: A Preview Section can be added under each group and record. It is a suitable place to display custom data for a given record or group.
- **Summary Section**: This section is a collection of rows used to display brief information about the groups or specific columns of the table.
- **Group Drop Area**: It lets the user group the grid data. The data can be grouped by simply dragging the column headers into the group drop area.

### Feature Summary

**Grid Control:**

Grid control is a powerful control that is implemented by using a unique Styles Architecture. This grid control, which is similar to Microsoft Excel, allows detailed customization of the control down to the cell level. Multi-level Undo/Redo, shared scroll bar support, data/view separation, floating cells, more than 18 cell types, and unmatched extensibility are unique features of the Grid control.
