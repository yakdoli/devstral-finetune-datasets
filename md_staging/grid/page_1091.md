### Dragging and Binding the Grid Aware Text Box
Drag the Grid Aware Text Box from your toolbox and drop it on a form along with either a Grid control or a Grid Data Bound Grid. Finally, in your Form_Load handler, add a call to the GridAwareTextBox.WireGrid to bind the Grid Aware Text Box to the grid. Here are some code samples that will show you how this is done.

#### C#
```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    // Bind Grid Aware Text Box to grid.
    this.gridAwareTextBox1.WireGrid(this.gridControl1);
}
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs)
    ' Bind Grid Aware Text Box to grid.
    Me.gridAwareTextBox1.WireGrid(Me.gridControl1)
End Sub
```

### 4.7 Grid Helper Classes
Grid control provides a collection of grid helper classes to achieve specific functionalities. You need to refer the `Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.Windows` assembly in your Windows application to make use of these helper classes. The various helper classes and their usage are described in the following topics.

#### 4.7.1 Grid to PDF Conversion
Grid control provides support to convert the grid content to PDF format. You can convert the grid content into a PDF document for offline verification and/or computation. This is achieved by making use of the `GridPDFConverter` class.

PDF libraries support the conversion of grid content to a PDF page. The following dependent assemblies need to be referenced for this purpose along with the default assemblies that are present in the References folder of your Windows application: `Syncfusion.Pdf.Base` and `Syncfusion.GridHelperClasses.Windows`.
