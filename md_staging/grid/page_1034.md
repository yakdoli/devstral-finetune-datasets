# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## 4.3.4.14.1.9 RecordExpanding Event

It occurs before a record with a nested table is expanded.

The event handler receives an argument of type `RecordEventArgs` containing data related to this event.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Cancel` | Gets or sets a value indicating whether the event should be canceled. |
| `Record` | Gets the affected record. |

### Handling Table Record Expansion

The parent records that have no child record can be prevented from expanding by handling the `Table.RecordExpanding` event and by setting `e.Cancel` to `true`, when there is no child records for a parent record.

#### Code Examples

[C#]

```csharp
private void Table_RecordExpanding(object sender, RecordEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Record.GetRelatedChildTable(new RelationDescriptor("ParentToChild")).GetRecordCount() == 0)
        e.Cancel = true;
}
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
Private Sub Table_RecordExpanding(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RecordEventArgs)
    If e.Record.GetRelatedChildTable(New RelationDescriptor("ParentToChild")).GetRecordCount() = 0 Then
        e.Cancel = True
    End If
End Sub
```

## 4.3.4.14.1.10 RecordValueChanging Event

It occurs when a `RecordFieldCell` cell's value is changed and before `Record.SetValue` is returned.
