# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
this.gridControl1.Model.EnableGridListControlInComboBox = true;
```

```vb
Me.gridControl1.Model.EnableGridListControlInComboBox = true
```

If you want to create an application for which the combo box is created from the GridComboBoxCellModel and not to use the GridDropDownGridListControlCellModel, you need to set the `EnableGridListControlInComboBox` property to `false`. By default, this is set to `true`. The following code illustrates how to disable the `EnableGridListControlInComboBox` property:

```csharp
this.gridControl1.Model.EnableGridListControlInComboBox = false;
```

```vb
this.gridControl1.Model.EnableGridListControlInComboBox = false;
```
