# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates the use of cross-sheet references in the Essential Grid for Windows Forms.
- Provides an example of how the Display sheet calculates and displays Annual Income, while the Calculations sheet computes and displays Tax Deductions.
- Introduces the concept of named ranges in Grid Formula Engine.

## Content

### Cross-Sheet References

#### Figure 135: Cross Sheet References

After computing the values, the Display sheet displays the Annual Income and Calculations sheet displays the Tax Deductions.

A sample that demonstrates this feature is available in the following sample installation path:

```
C:\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\[Version Number]\Windows\Grid.Windows\Samples\2.0\Formula Support\Cross-Reference Demo
```

#### 4.1.4.6.8 Named Ranges

- Essential Grid supports named ranges along with Grid Formula Engine.
- Named ranges allow users to assign names to expressions or ranges, enabling their use in formulas.
- For example, naming the range "B4:B12" as "Expenses" allows formulas like `=Sum(Expenses)` instead of `=Sum(B4:B12)`.
