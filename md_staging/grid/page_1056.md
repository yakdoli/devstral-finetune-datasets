### 4.3.4.14.5.3 MouseUp Event
The `MouseUp` event occurs when the mouse pointer leaves the control and a mouse button is pressed. It receives an argument of type `MouseEventArgs` that provides data related to this event. This event can be invoked as follows:

#### C#
```csharp
this.gridGroupingControl1.TableControlMouseUp += new 
MouseEventHandler(TableControl_MouseUp);
```

#### VB.NET
```vbnet
Private Me.gridGroupingControl1.TableControlMouseUp += New 
MouseEventHandler(TableControl_MouseUp)
```

The following `MouseEventArgs` properties provide information specific to this event:

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Button | Gets which mouse button (left or right) is pressed. |
| Clicks | Gets the number of times the mouse button was pressed and released. |
| Delta | Gets a signed count of the number of detents the mouse wheel has rotated. A detent is one notch of the mouse wheel. |
| Location | Gets the mouse location during generating this event. |
| X | Gets X co-ordinate of the mouse during generating this event. |
| Y | Gets Y co-ordinate of the mouse during generating this event. |
