## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Through Designer

**Overview**

- Instructions on incorporating both the Grid Record Navigation control and a Grid control into a Windows Forms application using the designer.
- Emphasis on proper initialization by dragging and positioning controls correctly.
- Step-by-step guidance for designers to ensure accurate setup.

### Content

**4.5.1.1 Through Designer**

With the designer, you can drag both the Grid Record Navigation control and a Grid control (either Grid control or Grid Data Bound Grid) from the toolbox onto your form. But, to get the proper initialization code generated by the designer, you must first drop and position the Grid Record Navigation control on your form and then drag the grid directly onto the Grid Record Navigation control. Do not drop the grid onto the form.

#### Steps:

1. **Drag a GridRecordNavigationControl object from your toolbox and drop it on the form.**

2. **Size and position it.**

3. **Drag a GridDataBoundGrid object from your toolbox and drop it on the Grid Record Navigation control (and not the form itself).**

### Note

Ensure proper positioning and dragging steps to avoid incorrect initialization code.

### API Reference

- **Classes**: GridRecordNavigationControl, GridDataBoundGrid

### Code Examples

C#:
```csharp
// Drag GridRecordNavigationControl onto the form.
GridRecordNavigationControl navControl = new GridRecordNavigationControl();
navControl.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;

// Drag GridDataBoundGrid onto the GridRecordNavigationControl.
GridDataBoundGrid grid = new GridDataBoundGrid();
grid.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;

navControl.Controls.Add(grid);
```
