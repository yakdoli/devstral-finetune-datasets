### 5.4.51 How to export the user-defined function from Grid to Excel workbook?

To export the user-defined formula library function from Grid to Excel:

1. Create an Excel Add-In file (*.xla) including the user-defined function as illustrated in the following link: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa140990(v=office.10).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa140990(v=office.10).aspx).
2. Now, bind the add-in file path and custom method name with `GridExcelConverterControl` through the `AddCustomFunction` method.

#### Creating the XLA File

To create an XLA file in Excel:

1. Create a new, empty workbook and click **Save As** from the **File** menu.
2. In the **Save As** dialog box, select the location to save the workbook. Enter the file name for the Add-In workbook, and then select the type as **Excel Add-In (*.xla)**.
3. Click **Save**, and then press ALT+ F11 to open the VBA Editor. Now, you can create the custom function through the VBA Editor.
