### Elements of Grid Control
- **Caption Section**  
  - This is the first section within a group which provides the caption bar above the column headers.
  - If a caption should be displayed at the beginning of each group, then Caption Sections are created when the grouping for a table is initialized.
  
- **Column Header Section**  
  - This section will appear at the top of a table or a group, below the caption section.
  - The Column Header Section is a placeholder where the grouping grid displays the column headers.
  
- **Filter Bar Row**  
  - It displays the filter bar for the table data.
  - You can enable the record filters for specific columns.
