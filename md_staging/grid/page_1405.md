# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Introduction

You can get the cell's rectangle in grid coordinates from the `RangeInfoToRectangle` method. Then with the rectangle's coordinates, you can get the screen point using the `PointToScreen` method.

### Example

```csharp
// For a given row and col.
Rectangle rect = this.grid.RangeInfoToRectangle(GridRangeInfo.Cell(row, col));
Point screenPoint = this.grid.PointToScreen(new Point(rect.Left, rect.Top));
```

```vb.net
' For a given row and col.
Dim rect As Rectangle = Me.grid.RangeInfoToRectangle(GridRangeInfo.Cell(row, col))
Dim screenPoint As Point = Me.grid.PointToScreen(New Point(rect.Left, rect.Top))
```

## 5.4.19 How to Get the New Value and the Old Value when an Item is Selected in a Combobox Cell

### Introduction

The `CurrentCellCloseDropDown` event gets triggered when a dropdown is closed in a grid cell. The new value of the `ComboBox` can be obtained from the `CurrentCell`'s `Renderer` property, and the old value can be obtained from the grid.

### Example

```csharp
GridCurrentCell cc;

// Handle CurrentCellCloseDropDown.
private void gridDataBoundGrid1_CurrentCellCloseDropDown(object sender, Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.PopupClosedEventArgs e)
{
}
```

## API Reference

### Methods
- `RangeInfoToRectangle(GridRangeInfo)`
- `PointToScreen(Point)`

### Events
- `CurrentCellCloseDropDown(object, PopupClosedEventArgs)`

## Code Examples

The code examples demonstrate how to use the methods and handle the event to retrieve the new and old values of a combobox cell in a grid.
