# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

![Figure 403: Grid List control created Through Code](image.jpg)

This designer-created data source is now available for use as the data source member of the Grid List control. For a complete step-by-step tutorial on how to use the designer to create a data source, see the Grid Data Bound Grid tutorial.

## 4.4.1.2 Through Code

The Grid List control sample that ships with Essential Grid does not use the designer. It creates an ArrayList of objects that serves as a data source for the Grid List control. Each state object has a LongName, ShortName, and `ImageIndex` properties that can be displayed in the list control. Here are some code samples that illustrate the assignments of the major properties.

For the complete implementation details, refer to the sample in the below installation path.

### Installation Path

`<Install Location>\Syncfusion\EssentialStudio\[Version Number]\Windows\Grid.Windows\Samples\2.0\Grid List Control`

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]

// Set to arraylist of states.
gridListBox1.DataSource = USStates;

// ImageListâ€”the images displayed in the list.
gridListBox1.ImageList = imageList;
```

### API Reference

- `gridListBox1.DataSource`: Specifies the data source for the grid list box.
- `gridListBox1.ImageList`: Specifies the `ImageList` to be used for displaying images in the grid control.

### Summary

- Demonstration of creating a Grid List control with data binding through code.
- Explanation of how to assign properties like `DataSource` and `ImageList`.
- Reference to sample code and tutorial for practical implementation.
