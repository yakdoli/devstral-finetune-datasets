# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Provides an overview of the Essential Grid control in Windows Forms.
- Demonstrates how to initialize and configure the grid to display categories.
- Explains the process of serializing and deserializing the grid schema using buttons provided in the interface.

### Grid Initialization and Serialization

#### CategoryGrid Example

The examples showcase the functionality of the Essential Grid control in a Windows Forms application. The grid displays categories with their respective IDs, names, and descriptions.

##### Figure 348: Startup Screen - Click Serialize to save Grid Schema

The startup screen of the `CategoryView` example is shown below. The grid contains the following columns:

- **CategoryID**: Numerical identifier for each category.
- **CategoryName**: Name of the category.
- **Description**: Detailed description of the category.

| CategoryID | CategoryName       | Description                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | Beverages          | Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales                              |
| 2          | Condiments          | Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings               |
| 3          | Confections        | Desserts, candies, and sweet breads                                      |
| 4          | Dairy Products     | Cheeses                                                                      |

Below the grid, you will find three buttons:

- **Serialize**: Click this button to save the grid schema.
- **Deserialize**: Click this button to load the previously saved grid schema.
- **Reset**: Click this button to reset the grid to its initial state.

##### Figure 349: After Serialization, reset the Grid

After serializing the grid schema, you can reset the grid to restore it to its default configuration. The grid will show the categories as before serialization.

#### Serialization Demonstration

The `Serialize` and `Deserialize` buttons facilitate saving and loading the grid configuration. This ensures that the grid's settings (layout, data, etc.) can be preserved across sessions.

### Buttons for Control

The following buttons are implemented for usability and persistence:

- **Serialize**: Saves the state of the Grid Schema.
- **Deserialize**: Loads the saved Grid Schema.
- **Reset**: Resets the Grid to its default state after saving or loading.

### Example Usage

The grid is effectively used to manage categories of items in a structured manner, and the buttons provide utilities for persistence and state management.

### Resetting the Grid

After performing serialization or deserialization, you can reset the Grid to its original state by clicking the Reset button. This ensures that the Grid is consistently updated to the desired state.
