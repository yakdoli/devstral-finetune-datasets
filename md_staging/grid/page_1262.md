## 5.2.15 How to Paste Clipboard Contents Bigger than GridDataBoundGrid Row and Column Count

### Introduction

The GridDataBoundGrid does not increment the row and column count as a GridControl. The reason for this is that the GridDataBoundGrid does not have its own datastore; it has to store these in the relevant datatable. To add rows and columns in the datatable, the Model.ClipboardPaste handler must be used.
