# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to retrieve and iterate through selected ranges in a grid control.

## Content

### Example

#### C#

```csharp
GridRangeInfoList rangeList = null;
this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Selections.GetSelectedRanges(out rangeList, false);
if (rangeList.Count > 0)
{
    foreach (GridRangeInfo range in rangeList)
    {
        for (int row = range.Top; row <= range.Bottom; ++row)
        {
            for (int col = range.Top; col <= range.Bottom; ++col)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Cell {0}, {1} selected", row, col));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### VB

```vb
Dim rangeList As GridRangeInfoList = Nothing
Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.Selections.GetSelectedRanges(rangeList, False)
If rangeList.Count > 0 Then
    For Each range As GridRangeInfo In rangeList
        For row As Integer = range.Top To range.Bottom
            For col As Integer = range.Left To range.Right
                Console.WriteLine(String.Format("Cell {0}, {1} selected", row, col))
            Next
        Next
    Next
End If
```

  - **Parameters:**
    - `rangeList`: The output parameter containing the selected ranges.
    - `secondary`: Indicates whether to include secondary selections.
  - **Returns:** A populated `GridRangeInfoList` containing the selected ranges.
  - **Remarks:** Useful for iterating through and processing selected cells or ranges in the grid.
