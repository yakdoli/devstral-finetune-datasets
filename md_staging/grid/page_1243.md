### Essential Grid for Windows Forms

```csharp
// If you haven't explicitly added GridBoundColumns.
this.gridDataBoundGrid1.Binder.InternalColumns["Price"].StyleInfo.BackColor = Color.Red;
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
' If you have added GridBoundColumns.
Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.GridBoundColumns("Price").StyleInfo.BackColor = Color.Red

' If you haven't explicitly added GridBoundColumns.
Me.gridDataBoundGrid1.Binder.InternalColumns("Price").StyleInfo.BackColor = Color.Red
```

### 5.2.3 How to Change the Backcolor of a Single Cell

#### Introduction

In a GridDataBoundGrid, you cannot set cell specific properties like `backcolor` (other than `CellValue` or text) using an indexer. The reason is that in a GridDataBoundGrid, the only data storage is the bound datasource, which only holds a single value per cell. It does not hold `textcolor`, `backcolor`, or any of the other many cell-specific properties that are found in a `GridStyleInfo` object.

This code does not work.

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Set the backcolor of cell(8,10).
this.gridDataBoundGrid1[8, 10].BackColor = Color.Red;
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
' Set the backcolor of cell(8,10).
Me.gridDataBoundGrid1(8, 10).BackColor = Color.Red;
```

So, in order to set cell specific properties in a GridDataBoundGrid, you must catch the `PrepareViewStyleInfo` event (or `Model.QueryCellInfo` event). In your handler, check `e.RowIndex` and `e.ColIndex` and if these point to the cell you want to change, set `e.Style` to the value you want.
