## 4.3.4.3.4.2.3 Working with Filters

This section deals with different options to process the filter rows.

### Accessing FilteredRecords

If you want to work with the subset of the records being filtered from a grid table, then you can use FilteredRecords collection for that table. This is a read-only collection that manages the subset of records that has been filtered against a filter criteria.

#### [C#]

```csharp
GridTable table = this.grid.Table;
foreach (Record frec in table.FilteredRecords)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Record Info : " + frec);
}
```

#### [VB.NET]

```vb
Private table As GridTable = Me.grid.Table
For Each frec As Record In table.FilteredRecords
    Console.WriteLine("Record Info : " & frec)
Next frec
```
