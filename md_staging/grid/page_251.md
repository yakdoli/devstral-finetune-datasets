# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

where:

- Ai is the number of accrued days for the ith quasi-coupon period within an odd period.
- NC is the number of quasi-coupon periods that fit in an odd period. If this number contains a fraction, raise it to the next whole number.
- NLi is the normal length in days of the ith quasi-coupon period within an odd period.

## 4.1.4.6.6.3 ACOS

Returns the inverse cosine of a number. Inverse cosine is also referred to as arccosine. The arccosine is the angle whose cosine is the given number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range of 0 to pi.

### Syntax

**ACOS(number)**, where:

- **number** is the cosine of the angle that you want and must be between -1 and 1.

## 4.1.4.6.6.4 ACOSH

Returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of a number. The number must be greater than or equal to 1. The inverse hyperbolic cosine is the value whose hyperbolic cosine is the given number.

### Syntax

**ACOSH(number)**, where:

- **number** is any real number that is greater than or equal to 1.

## 4.1.4.6.6.5 ACOT

The ACOT function retrieves the principal value of the inverse cotangent or arccotangent of a number.

### Syntax

**ACOT(number)** where:

- **number** is the cotangent of the angle you need.
