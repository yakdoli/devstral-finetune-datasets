#### 4.3.4.3.4.1.2 List of Expressions

##### A note on Valid Expression Syntax

**Expressions** may be any well-formed algebraic combination of column mapping names enclosed with brackets ([]), numerical constants and literals, and the algebraic and logical operators are listed below.

The computations are performed as listed, with level one operations done first. Alpha constants used with match and like should be enclosed in apostrophes ('`.

- *, / : multiplication, division.
- +, - : addition, subtraction.
- <, >, =, <=, >=: less than, greater than, equal, less than or equal.
- match, like, in, between.
- or, and.

**Below is the list of operators used and their descriptions.**

| Expression | Syntax       | Description           | Example Usage |
