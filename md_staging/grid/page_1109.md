## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

### Using VB.NET

RegisterCellModel.GridCellType(gridControl1, CustomCellTypes.Calendar)
Dim style As GridStyleInfo
style = gridControl1(row, 2)
style.CellType = "Calendar"

' Provide a Month Calendar control for drawing cell contents.
style.Control = New MonthCalendar()
```

### DateTimePicker

You can implement a Date Time Picker control in grid cells by using the DateTimePicker cell type. This cell type is implemented as a drop-down container, embedded into the cell, where the date and time picker is added. The drop down contains the calendar which displays and stores the date value in the cell. Various formats for the date and time can be specified by using the Format style property.
