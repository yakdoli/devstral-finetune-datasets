## Essential Grid for Windows Forms

The style object holds all the information that affects the cells appearance. One property contained in the style object is its `BackColor`. Use a two-parameter indexer (rowIndex, colIndex) on your GridControl object to get a reference to that particular cells style, a `GridStyleInfo` object.

### Example

```csharp
// Changing the BackColor of a cell in the 1st row and 3rd column.
gridControl[1, 3].BackColor = Color.Red;
```

```vb.net
' Changing the BackColor of a cell in the 1st row and 3rd column.
GridControl(1, 3).BackColor = Color.Red
```

### 5.1.8 How to Change the Backcolor of a Single Row

#### Introduction

The `GridControl.RowStyles` collection contains `GridStyleInfo` objects that provide row style settings for the GridControl. Changing the properties on a particular RowStyle will affect all the cells in that row (unless a particular cell has a more specific style setting, like a `cellstyle`, applied).

#### Example

```csharp
// Setting the BackColor of the 3rd row.
gridControl.RowStyles[3].BackColor = Color.Red;
```

```vb.net
' Setting the BackColor of the 3rd row.
GridControl.RowStyles(3).BackColor = Color.Red
```
