### 4.3.4.10 Grid Designer

The Grid Grouping control has strong designer support. You can control all aspects of the grid's appearance through the designer. Additional commands (verbs) will let you save layouts and restore them. You can also use a preview feature that will let you load data into your control and then further set the Grid Grouping control properties that can be persisted as design-time properties.

Clicking the Preview and Edit verb will allow you to view the Grid Grouping control, populated with data along with a companion property grid as seen in the picture below. It also displays help description for the properties that are being selected. You can use the property grid to change the Grid Grouping control's properties and see the effect immediately upon the populated control. When you close the preview, you will have the option of saving any changed properties to the property grid in the designer. We will use this Preview and Edit support to see the effects of setting the various TableOption properties.
