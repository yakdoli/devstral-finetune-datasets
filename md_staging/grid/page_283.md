# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview
- 1. DSTDEVP function calculates standard deviation of a population.
- 2. DSUM function adds numbers in a field that matches specified conditions.
- 3. Duration function returns the annual duration of a security with periodic interest payments.
- 4. DVAR function estimates the variance of a population based on a sample.

## Content

### DSTDEVP
The DSTDEVP function calculates the standard deviation of a population based on the entire population, using the numbers in a column of a list or database that match the conditions that have been specified.

**Syntax:**
DSTDEVP(database, field, criteria)
Where:
- **database** is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
- **field** indicates which column is used in the function.
- **criteria** is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.

### DSUM
The DSUM function adds the numbers in a field (column) of records in a list or database that matches the conditions that have been specified.

**Syntax:**
DSUM(database, field, criteria)
Where:
- **database** is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
- **field** indicates which column is used in the function.
- **criteria** is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.

### Duration
Returns the annual duration of a security with periodic interest payments.

**Syntax:**
Duration (settlement, maturity, coupon, yld, frequency, basis)
Where:
- **Settlement** – a security’s settlement date.
- **Maturity** – a security’s maturity date.
- **Coupon** – the annual coupon rate.
- **Yld** – security’s annual yield.
- **Frequency** – the number of coupon payments per year.
- **Basis** – the type of day count basis.

### DVAR
The DVAR function estimates the variance of a population based on a sample by using the numbers in a column of a list or database which matches the conditions that is been specified.

**Syntax:**
DVAR(database, field, criteria)
Where:
- **database** is the range of cells that makes up the list or database.
- **field** indicates which column is used in the function.
- **criteria** is the range of cells that contains the conditions that you specify.
