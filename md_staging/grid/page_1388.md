## 5.4.7 How to Control the Number of Visible Items in a Combo Box Cell

### Introduction

The `GridComboBoxListBoxPart` has a `DropDownRows` property that you can set to control the number of visible items. The `GridComboBoxListBoxPart` is the actual control type of the list that is displayed when the dropdown is activated. However, since it is not directly accessible and is shared among all combo box cells, you need to handle this property dynamically. This is because each combo box cell can have a different list of items and may require a different number of visible rows. To achieve this, you must capture the `Grid.CurrentCellShowingDropDown` event and set the `DropDownRows` property based on the exact row and column.

### Example

```csharp
[C#]

private void grid_CurrentCellShowingDropDown(object sender, GridCurrentCellShowingDropDownEventArgs e)
{
    GridControlBase grid = sender as GridControlBase;
    if (grid != null)
    {
        GridCurrentCell cc = grid.CurrentCell;
        GridComboBoxCellRenderer cr = cc.Renderer as GridComboBoxCellRenderer;

        // Set number of visible items for combo boxes in different rows.
        if (cc != null)
        {
            if (cc.RowIndex == 6)
            {
                ((GridComboBoxListBoxPart)cr.ListBoxPart).DropDownRows = 4;
            }
            else if (cc.RowIndex == 4)
            {
                ((GridComboBoxListBoxPart)cr.ListBoxPart).DropDownRows = 7;
            }
            else if (cc.RowIndex == 2)
            {
                ((GridComboBoxListBoxPart)cr.ListBoxPart).DropDownRows = 10;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
```
