# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Content

### Splitter

Figure 126: Workbook

#### 4.1.4.5.4 Splitter

A dynamic-splitter window can be embedded in Essential Grid to show multiple views of the same grid by using a Splitter. This MS Excel-like feature enables you to view more than one copy of a worksheet, and scroll through each pane of the worksheet independently. The panes work simultaneously, i.e., the changes made in one pane are reflected in the other. The splitter can be scrolled by placing the mouse pointer over it, holding down the left mouse button and dragging it to the required position. It can be split horizontally and vertically.

##### Events Associated with the Splitter Control

The following are the events associated with the Splitter control.
