### WinForms Events on Record Collapsed and Collapsing

```vb
' The RecordCollapsed event gets fired after the record is collapsed
Private Sub gridGroupingControl1_RecordCollapsed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Grouping.RecordEventArgs) Handles gridGroupingControl1.RecordCollapsed
    Console.WriteLine("Collapsed" + e.Record.Info)
End Sub

' The RecordCollapsing event gets fired when the record is collapsing
Private Sub gridGroupingControl1_RecordCollapsing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Grouping.RecordEventArgs) Handles gridGroupingControl1.RecordCollapsing
    Console.WriteLine("Collapsing" + e.Record.Info)
