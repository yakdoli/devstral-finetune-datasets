# Essential Grid for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Discusses trigonometric and hyperbolic functions in aligned with Windows Forms programming.
- Includes **ASECH**, **ASIN**, **ASINH**, and **ATAN** functions with their respective descriptions and syntax.
- Focuses on mathematical operations within the context of scripting and programming.

## Content

```none
x = asech(y) where:
```
- **x** is a complex or real array.
- **y** is a complex or real array.

### 4.1.4.6.6.12 ASIN

**Description:** Returns the inverse sine of a number. Inverse sine is also referred to as arcsine. The arcsine is the angle whose sine is the given number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range from -pi/2 to +pi/2.

#### Syntax
```none
ASIN(number), where:
```
- **number** is the sine of the angle that you want and must be between -1 and 1.

---

### 4.1.4.6.6.13 ASINH

**Description:** Returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of a number. The inverse hyperbolic sine is the value whose hyperbolic sine is the given number, so ASINH(SINH(number)) equals number.

#### Syntax
```none
ASINH(number), where:
```
- **number** is any real number.

---

### 4.1.4.6.6.14 ATAN

**Description:** Returns the inverse tangent of a number. Inverse tangent is also known as arctangent. The arctangent is the angle whose tangent is a number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range from -pi/2 to +pi/2.

#### Syntax
```none
ATAN(number), where:
```
- **number** is the tangent of the angle that you want.
