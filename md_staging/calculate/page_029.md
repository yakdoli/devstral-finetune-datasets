# Essential Calculate

This section will guide you to deploy Essential Calculate in those applications under the following topics:

- Windows-Step-by-step procedure to deploy Calculate in a Windows application.
- ASP.NET-Step-by-step procedure to deploy Calculate in an ASP.NET application.
- WPF-Step-by-step procedure to deploy Calculate in a WPF application.

## 3.3.1 Windows

Now, you have created a Windows application (refer Creating Platform Application). This section illustrates how to deploy Essential Calculate into this Windows application.

### Deploying Essential Calculate in a Windows Application

The following steps will guide you to deploy Essential Calculate:

1. Open the main form of the application in the designer.
2. Add the Syncfusion controls to your VS.NET toolbox if you haven't done so already [This is done automatically when you install Essential Studio].
3. In order to use the Essential Calculate library in your project, add the **CalculateConfig** component found in the toolbox to a project to enable support for Calculate.

## Code Examples
*Not explicitly mentioned in the image, but typically include samples demonstrating the integration.*

### Summary
- **What:** Deploying Essential Calculate in a Windows application.
- **How:** Use the CalculateConfig component from the toolbox.
- **Why:** To add custom calculation and formula capabilities in your Windows application.

## Cross References
- Refer to "Creating Platform Application" for setting up the initial application environment.
