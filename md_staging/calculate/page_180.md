## Overview

- Describes the syntax and usage of the `INDIRECT`, `INT`, and `INTERCEPT` functions.
- Explains how these functions handle numerical and textual data.
- Provides the equation for calculating the intercept of the regression line.

## Content

### 4.7.71 INT

**Description:**  
Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

**Syntax:**  
`INT(number)`

**Where:**  
- `number` is the real number that you want to round down to an integer.

---

### 4.7.72 INTERCEPT

**Description:**  
Calculates the point at which the least squares fit line will intersect the y-axis.

**Syntax:**  
`INTERCEPT(known_y's, known_x's)`

**Where:**  
- `known_y's` is the dependent set of observations or data.
- `known_x's` is the independent set of observations or data.

## Remarks

- The equation for the intercept of the regression line, \( a \), is:
