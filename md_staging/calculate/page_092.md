# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- The page demonstrates how to use a Microsoft Excel worksheet to perform calculations.
- Utilizing `VLOOKUP` and other features to generate an insurance quote based on input variables.
- The worksheet includes various input variables such as Age, Sex, State, Points, Model, Model Year, and Multiplediscount.

### Microsoft Excel Worksheet Example

The Microsoft Excel worksheet shown in the figure performs calculations to derive an insurance quote. The worksheet is titled "Copy of CarlIns.xls" and is read-only.

#### Key Information in the Worksheet
- **Input Variables** are listed in column A, with corresponding values in column B. The **Multiplier** for each variable is calculated and displayed in column C.
- **Age**: 15, with a multiplier of 1.4000.
- **Sex**: "m" (male), with a multiplier of 1.2000.
- **State**: "az" (Arizona), with a multiplier of 0.9604.
- **Points**: 0, with a multiplier of 1.0000.
- **Model**: "ford", with a multiplier of 1.0000.
- **ModelYear**: 2004, with a multiplier of 1.2350.
- **MultipleDiscount**: "no", with a multiplier of 1.0000.

#### Formula Usage
The cell `C5` uses the `VLOOKUP` function to retrieve the multiplier for the state:
\[ =VLOOKUP(State, LookUps!A3:B52, 2) \]

This formula helps in calculating the insurance quote by referencing a table in the "LookUps" sheet.

#### Tabs Overview
- The worksheet includes tabs named "Inputs", "LookUps", "Calculate", and "Outputs" to organize the data and calculations.

### Figure 39: Worksheet that Performs Calculations

The figure shows a detailed view of the worksheet that performs these calculations. It illustrates how various input variables and corresponding multipliers are used to calculate an insurance quote.

#### Table Layout

The table is structured as follows:

| Input Variable | value | Multiplier |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Age             | 15    | 1.4000     |
| Sex             | m     | 1.2000     |
| State           | az    | 0.9604     |
| Points          | 0     | 1.0000     |
| Model           | ford  | 1.0000     |
| ModelYear       | 2004  | 1.2350     |
| MultipleDiscount | no   | 1.0000     |

The **Multiplier** for the "State" column (`C5`) is calculated using the `VLOOKUP` function, as shown in the formula bar.

### Summary

This worksheet effectively uses Excel functions like `VLOOKUP` to calculate multipliers for various input variables, ultimately deriving an insurance quote. The organized structure and use of lookup tables ensure accurate and efficient computation.

## Code Examples (Example)
The formula used in the worksheet is as follows:
```excel
=VLOOKUP(State, LookUps!A3:B52, 2)
```

This formula retrieves the multiplier for the given state from the "LookUps" sheet.

## API Reference
- **VLOOKUP Function**: A standard Excel function used for lookup operations.
- **Worksheets Tabs**: "Inputs", "LookUps", "Calculate", and "Outputs" are used to organize the calculation process.
