# Essential Calculate

## 4.7.4 AND

Returns `True` if all the arguments have a logical value of `True` and returns `False` if at least one argument is `False`.

### Syntax

`AND(logical1, logical2, ...)`

#### Where:
- `logical1, logical2, ...` are multiple conditions you want to test for `True` or `False`.

### Remarks

- The arguments must evaluate to logical values (`True` or `False`).
- If an argument does not evaluate to `True` or `False`, those values are ignored.
- There must be at least one value in the argument list.

## 4.7.5 ASIN

Returns the inverse sine of a number. Inverse sine is also referred to as arcsine. The arcsine is the angle whose sine is the given number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range from `-pi/2` to `+pi/2`.

### Syntax

`ASIN(number)`

#### Where:
- `number` is the sine of the angle that you want and must be between `-1` and `1`.

## 4.7.6 ASINH

### Overview
- Functions for logical operations (`AND`).
- Returns the inverse sine of a number (`ASIN`).
- Operations related to `ASINH` are not detailed in this section.

### WinForms-specific conventions
- All methods and properties are documented using clear and concise language.
- Logical expressions and mathematical functions are explained with appropriate syntax.
- Each function's parameters and expected outputs are thoroughly defined.
