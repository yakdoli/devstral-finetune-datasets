## Overview
- Provides essential information about factorial calculations, logical values, and probability distributions.
- Explains the use and syntax of functions such as FACT, False, and FDIST.
- Includes details on how each function evaluates and returns specific values based on input parameters.

## Content

### 4.7.47 FACT
**Returns the factorial of a number.** The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers <= the given number.

#### Syntax
```csharp
FACT(number)
```

**where:**  
`number` is the non-negative number for which you want the factorial of. If the number is not an integer, it is truncated.

### 4.7.48 False
**The False function returns the logical value for the false.**

#### Syntax
```csharp
False(stringvalue)
```

**where:**  
- `stringvalue` is to provide an empty string.

### 4.7.49 FDIST
**Returns the F probability distribution.**

#### Syntax
```csharp
FDIST(x, degrees_freedom1, degrees_freedom2)
```

**where:**  
`x` is the value at which to evaluate the function.
