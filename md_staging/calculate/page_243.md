# 5 Frequently Asked Questions

This section will help you find answers to common questions regarding Essential Calculate. It includes the below sections:

## 5.1 CalcQuick

CalcQuick is the simplest way to incorporate calculation support into your code. You can create an instance of it then you can assign variables just by using an indexer on your instance. You can parse and compute formulas based on these variables by calling a single method on your CalcQuick object.

### 5.1.1 How To Add, Remove, And Modify the Implementation Of Functions In the Function Library In CalcQuickBase?

Refer the **Function Library** topic to know about this.

### 5.1.2 How To Calculate a Formula?

To calculate a formula, use the `ParseAndCompute` method from the `CalcQuickBase` class.

```csharp
// Declares a CalcQuickBase object.
private CalcQuickBase calculate;

//...

// Creates an instance.
this.calculate = new CalcQuickBase();

//... Set up any variables you need in your calculation.

// Calls the ParseAndCompute method to compute formulas.
string result = this.calculate.ParseAndCompute("4 * 5 + SQRT(3)");
```
