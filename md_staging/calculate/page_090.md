# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- This calculator uses Essential XlsIO alongside Essential Calculate, requiring no MS Excel installation.
- The car insurance calculator spreadsheet manages variable values via Names across four sheets designed for inputs, lookups, calculations, and outputs.

## Content

### Car Insurance Calculator Overview

The spreadsheet you are using is a car insurance calculator. It uses Names to manage variable values and has the following four sheets:

- **Inputs**: Contains the input values for the car insurance calculations like the state, age, and so on.
- **LookUps**: Contains data that determine insurance rates. For example, each state has a weight assigned to it; each age has a weight assigned to it, and so on.
- **Calculate**: Does the actual calculations. Based on the input values from the input sheet, formulas in this sheet, look up appropriate weights from the LookUps sheet, and compute the car insurance cost depending upon these weights.
- **Outputs**: Contains the computed results obtained from the Calculate sheet.

*Figure 37: Worksheet that Receives Inputs*

The illustration depicts a Microsoft Excel sheet titled "Inputs," which serves as the primary input area for the calculator. This sheet includes fields such as Age, Sex, State, Points, Model, ModelYear, and MultipleDiscount. The "Define Name" panel on the right shows the named ranges in the workbook, including Age, BaseAmount, Model, ModelYear, MultipleDiscount, Points, Sex, and State. These named ranges ensure that the input values can be easily referenced and managed across the various sheets involved in the computation process.

### Key Features and Workflow

- **Inputs Sheet**:  
  - Users input data such as Age, Sex, State, Points, Model, ModelYear, and whether a MultipleDiscount applies.  
  - These values are critical for the subsequent calculations.  
  - The BaseAmount is also specified here, which serves as the starting point for the insurance cost.

- **LookUps Sheet**:  
  - Contains predefined rates and weights based on various factors, such as state and age.  
  - These rates are used in conjunction with the inputs to compute the final insurance cost.

- **Calculate Sheet**:  
  - Utilizes formulas to process the inputs and apply the appropriate weights and rates from the LookUps sheet.  
  - Computes the final insurance cost based on the complex interplay of input variables and lookup rates.

- **Outputs Sheet**:  
  - Presents the final computed insurance cost derived from the Calculate sheet.  
  - Provides a clear and concise output for the user after all calculations are completed.

### How Names Enhance Functionality

Using Names in the spreadsheet allows for better organization and management of variable values. It facilitates easy referencing of specific cells across different sheets without the need to memorize cell addresses. This becomes especially useful as the complexity of the calculations increases, as in the case of a car insurance calculator, where numerous variables interact to determine the final result.
