## Overview

1. Implements a class for managing array calculation data tailored for the Syncfusion Winforms framework.
2. Introduces `ArrayCalcData` class in VB and C# syntax with support for additional rows and columns as well as row and column counts for convenience.

## Content

### Implementation Details

This section illustrates how to integrate additional rows and columns into synchronization-based data processing using the `ArrayCalcData` class in both VB and C#.

#### VB Implementation

```vb
Imports System

Namespace Calculate_ICalcData
    '''
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Summary description for ArrayCalcData.
    ''' </summary>
    Public Class ArrayCalcData
        Public Sub New()
            ' TODO: Add constructor logic here.
        End Sub
    End Class
End Namespace
```

#### C# Implementation

```csharp
using System;
using Syncfusion.Calculate;

namespace Calculate_ICalcData
{
    public class ArrayCalcData
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Original double array.
        /// </summary>
        private double[,] dValues;

        /// <summary>
        /// Vector holding the sum of the rows.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Serves as the last column.
        /// </remarks>
        private object[] rowSums;

        /// <summary>
        /// Vector holding the sum of the columns.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Serves as the last row.
        /// </remarks>
    }
}
```

### Enhancements for Synchronization

The `ArrayCalcData` class provides enhanced functionality with the ability to synchronize additional data structures such as row and column sums for performing quick calculations. This is particularly useful in large-scale data manipulation and can be extended for flexibility and scalability.

#### Remarks

- The `dValues` array holds the main data for calculations.
- `rowSums` acts as an additional column, used to store the sum of each row, enhancing indexed calculations.
- Similarly, the column sums feature, which acts as the last row, provides efficient access to column summations.

The additional fields and logic facilitate more complex operations in data processing tasks where multiple summaries are required.

### API Reference

#### Class: `ArrayCalcData`

- **Purpose**: Provides a structure to hold and process array calculation data, including supplementary row and column summation data.

- **Fields**:
  - `dValues`: Holds the original double array.
  - `rowSums`: Represents the sum of rows; used as an additional column for various synthesis tasks.
  - `columnSums`: Represents the sum of columns; used as an additional row for similar tasks.

#### Methods

- **Constructor**: Initializes the `ArrayCalcData` object. Additional logic can be added as required for specific use cases.

### Code Examples

#### Example in C#

```csharp
using System;

public class ArrayCalcDataUsage
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the ArrayCalcData object
        var calcData = new Calculate.ICalcData.ArrayCalcData();

        // Example of accessing and updating the data structures
        // (Further implementation depends on specific application requirements)
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the initialization of the `ArrayCalcData` class and sets a foundation for additional functionality to be implemented.
