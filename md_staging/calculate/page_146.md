# Essential Calculate

**y_num** is the Y coordinate of the point.

## Remarks

- A positive result represents a counterclockwise angle from the x-axis; a negative result represents a clockwise angle.
- ATAN2(a,b) equals ATAN(b/a), except that `a` can equal 0 in ATAN2.

### 4.7.9 ATANH

**Returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of a number.** Number must be strictly between -1 and 1. The inverse hyperbolic tangent is the value whose hyperbolic tangent is number, so `ATANH(TANH(number))` equals the given number.

#### Syntax

`ATANH(number)`

where:

- **number** is any real number that is between 1 and -1.

### 4.7.10 AVEDEV

**Returns the average of the absolute mean deviations of data points.** AVEDEV is a measure of the variability in a data set.

#### Syntax

`AVEDEV(number1, number2, ...)`

where:

- **number1, number2, â€¦** are arguments for which you want the average of the absolute deviations. You can also use a single array or a reference to an array instead of arguments separated by commas.
