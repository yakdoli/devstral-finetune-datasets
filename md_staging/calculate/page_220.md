# Essential Calculate

## Content

### 4.7.147 SLN

**Returns the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period.**

#### Syntax

```markdown
SLN(cost, salvage, life)
```

#### Parameters:

- **cost**: The initial cost of the asset.
- **salvage**: The value at the end of the depreciation (sometimes called the salvage value of the asset).
- **life**: The number of periods over which the asset is depreciated (the useful life of the asset).

### 4.7.148 SLOPE

**Returns the slope of the linear regression line through data points in known_y's and known_x's. The slope is the rate of change along the regression line.**

#### Syntax

```markdown
SLOPE(known_y's, known_x's)
```

#### Parameters:

- **known_y's**: An array or cell range of numeric dependent data points.
- **known_x's**: The set of independent data points.

#### Remarks

- The equation for the slope of the regression line is:
