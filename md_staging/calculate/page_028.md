**Figure 12: New Project Dialog Box**

A new WPF application is created.

1. Open the main form of the application in the designer.
   
2. Add the Syncfusion controls to your VS.NET toolbox if you haven't done so already [This is done automatically when you install Essential Studio].

3. Now you need to deploy Essential Calculate into this WPF application. Refer the [WPF] topic for detailed information.

For more information, refer the following topic.

### 3.3 Deploying Essential Calculate

We have now created a platform application in the previous topic (Creating Platform Application).
