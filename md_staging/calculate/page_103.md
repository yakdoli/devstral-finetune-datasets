# Essential Calculate

The explicit look of a valid formula in Essential Calculate may vary depending upon the context of the formula. For example, if you are using a formula in a `CalcSheet` class based on an Excel spreadsheet, then something like `= A1 + A3` will be valid since `CalcSheet` recognizes the "A1" and "A3" as valid cell references. But, if you are using a `CalcQuickBase` object to manage formulas for controls on a Windows Form, then the same `= A1 + A3` will not be valid since `CalcQuickBase` only recognizes registered names inside square brackets as valid arguments. Hence, all Essential Calculation formulas support the same algebra with the exception of what comprises the definition of valid arguments.

## Overview
- The explicit validity of formulas depends on the context (e.g., `CalcSheet` vs. `CalcQuickBase`).
- `CalcSheet` supports Excel-style cell references like "A1" and "A3."
- `CalcQuickBase` requires arguments in a different format (e.g., registered names inside square brackets).
- All formulas support the same algebra, differing only in valid argument formats.

## Content

### 4.4.1 Operators
