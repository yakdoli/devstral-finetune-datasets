### Lookup Tables in Excel

This section illustrates the use of lookup tables in an Excel worksheet to perform calculations based on various attributes. Figure 38 below shows the worksheet that contains these lookup tables:

The worksheet is divided into several tables:

- **State Factor Lookup Table**: Located in columns A and B, this table maps each state to a specific factor used in the calculations.
- **Age Lookup Table**: Located in columns E and F, this table provides age-related multipliers.
- **Sex Lookup**: Located in columns I and J, this table assigns multipliers based on gender.
- **Points**: Located in column L, this column provides values for points based on the data.
- **Model Year**: Located in columns O and P, this table includes the model year along with an associated value.

### Explanation of Columns

1. **A** - **State**: Abbreviated names of states in the United States.
2. **B** - **State Factor**: Values representing the state-specific factors used in calculations.
3. **C** - **Age**: Various age ranges or specific ages.
4. **F** - **Age Multiplier**: Multipliers based on the age values in column E.
5. **I** - **Sex**: Genders represented as M (Male) or F (Female).
6. **J** - **Sex Multiplier**: Multipliers based on the gender values in column I.
7. **L** - **Points**: Values assigned to specific entries.
8. **M** - **Multiplier**: Multipliers used in conjunction with the points and other factors.
9. **O** - **Model Year**: Various model years.
10. **P** - **Value**: Specific values related to the model year.

This setup enables users to perform complex lookups and calculations using a structured set of data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in processing.

### Code Examples
#### Example: Using Lookup Tables in .NET
```csharp
// Example code snippet in C#
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.LookupTable;

// Assuming a LookupTable object named "stateFactorTable"
double stateFactor = stateFactorTable.GetValue("AZ");

// Similarly, retrieving age-related values
double ageFactor = ageTable.GetValue(25);

// Combining values from multiple tables
double totalFactor = stateFactor * ageFactor;
```
