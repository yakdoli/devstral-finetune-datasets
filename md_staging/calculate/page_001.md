```csharp
// Example of integrating Essential Calculate with a Winforms application
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Calculate;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        // Initialize the Calculate component
        EssentialCalculate calculate = new EssentialCalculate();
        calculate.DestinationControl = textBoxResult;
        calculate.FunctionName = "SUM";
        calculate.SourceRange = "A1:A10";

        // Attach to a control
        this.Controls.Add(calculate);
    }
}
```

### Example: Custom Function Example

```csharp
// Example of adding a custom function to Essential Calculate
calculate.CustomFunction += (sender, e) =>
{
    if (e.FunctionName == "MYFUNCTION")
    {
        e.Result = e.Parameters[0] + e.Parameters[1];
    }
};
```
