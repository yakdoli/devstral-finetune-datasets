## Content

### Essential Calculate

- columns is the number of columns you want to apply as the offset to the range. This can be either a positive or a negative number.
- height is the number of rows that you want the returned range to be.
- width is the number of columns that you want the returned range to be.

### 4.7.118 OR

**Returns True if any argument is True; returns False if all arguments are False.**

#### Syntax

`OR(logical1, logical2, ...)`

**where**:  
logical1, logical2, ... are conditions you want to test that can be either True or False.

#### Remarks
- The arguments must evaluate to logical values such as True or False or in arrays or references that contain logical values.

### 4.7.119 PEARSON

**Returns the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, r, a dimensionless index that ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 inclusive and reflects the extent of a linear relationship between two data sets.**

#### Syntax

`PEARSON(array1, array2)`

**where**:  
- array1 is a set of independent values.  
- array2 is a set of dependent values.

#### Remarks
