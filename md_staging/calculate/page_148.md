# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- Implements a simple calculation engine.
- Covers functions for calculating averages.
- Explains syntax and usage of AVERAGEA, AVG, and BINOMDIST functions.

## Content

### AVERAGEA

#### Syntax
```plaintext
AVERAGEA(value1, value2,...)
```

#### Where:
- `value1, value2, ...` are cells, ranges of cells, or values for which you want the average.

#### Remarks
- The arguments must be numbers, names, arrays, or references.
- Array or reference arguments that contain text evaluate as 0 (zero).
- If the calculation should not include text values in the average, then use the AVERAGE function.
- Arguments that contain True evaluate as 1; arguments that contain False evaluate as 0 (zero).

### 4.7.13 AVG

#### Returns
The average (arithmetic mean) of the arguments.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
AVG(number1, number2,...)
```

#### Where:
- `number1, number2, ...` are numeric arguments for which you want the average.

#### Remarks
- This method is the same as AVERAGE and is included for compatibility purposes.

### 4.7.14 BINOMDIST

#### Returns
The individual term binomial distribution probability.

#### Syntax
