## Essential Calculate

Returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of a number. The inverse hyperbolic sine is the value whose hyperbolic sine is the given number, so ASINH(SINH(number)) equals number.

### Syntax

```
ASINH(number)
```

where:  
`number` is any real number.

---

### 4.7.7 ATAN

Returns the inverse tangent of a number. Inverse tangent is also known as arctangent. The arctangent is the angle whose tangent is a number. The returned angle is given in radians in the range from -pi/2 to +pi/2.

#### Syntax

```
ATAN(number)
```

where:  
`number` is the tangent of the angle that you want.

---

### 4.7.8 ATAN2

Returns the inverse tangent of the specified x and y coordinates. The arctangent is the angle from the x-axis to a line containing the origin (0, 0) and the point (x_num, y_num). The angle is given in radians between -pi and pi, excluding -pi.

#### Syntax

```
ATAN2(x_num, y_num)
```

where:  
`x_num` is the X coordinate of the point.
