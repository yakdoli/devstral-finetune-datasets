# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- Describes the general calculation design process using Excel to design complex calculations for batch processing.
- Explains how named variables in Excel can facilitate simple application functionality on systems without Excel.

### Excel Named Variables

This layout represents a general calculation design process which you can use for batch processing of information. The idea is that you change the inputs (all on a single sheet) and then return the outputs (all from a single sheet). There may be a web service or a server application that will allow clients to upload inputs and then download outputs. Or it could just be a batch processing calculation engine. Using this technique, you can use Excel to design complex calculations and then have a simple application that runs on systems without Excel, to input new values and retrieve computed results.

For example, consider the below form which accepts input values from the user. Once the values are set, the user clicks a button on the form that puts these values into the inputs sheet and then retrieves the insurance costs from the Outputs sheet and displays it on the form.
