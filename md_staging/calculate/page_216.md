# Essential Calculate

## Overview

- number is any real number that you want rounded down.
- Num_digits is the number of digits to which you want to round a number.

### Remark

- ROUNDOWN behaves like ROUND, except that it always rounds a number down.

## 4.7.140 ROUNDUP

### Overview

- Rounds a number up away from 0 (zero).

### Syntax

ROUNDUP(number, num_digits)

**where:**

- number is any real number that you want rounded up.
- num_digits is the number of digits to which you want to round a number.

### Remarks

- ROUNDUP behaves like ROUND, except that it always rounds a number up.

## 4.7.141 RSQ

### Overview

- Returns the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient through data points in known_y's and known_x's.

### Syntax

RSQ(known_y's, known_x's)

**where:**

- known_y's is an array or range of data points.
- known_x's is an array or range of data points.
