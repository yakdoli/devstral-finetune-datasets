## 2.3 Deployment Requirements

This section elaborates on the deployment requirements for using Essential Calculate in various applications. It comprises the following topics:

### 2.3.1 DLLs

The following DLLs need to be referenced in your application for the usage of Essential Calculate.

- Syncfusion.Core.dll
- Syncfusion.Calculate.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.Calculate.Windows.dll
- Syncfusion.Shared.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.Shared.Web.dll

### 2.3.2 Web Application Deployment

Web application by default is deployed in full trust mode. This section discusses the deployment in medium or partial trust scenarios.

### Deploying in Medium Trust or Partial Trust Scenarios

There are two such scenarios in which Syncfusion assemblies might be deployed.

#### Example 1

If the Syncfusion Assemblies are in GAC (Global Assembly Cache), and the Web Application is running in **medium** trust, then the Syncfusion assemblies actually runs in full trust. Hence this scenario is fully supported and there are no additional steps necessary for deployment.

#### Example 2

Say, the Syncfusion Assemblies are present in the application's bin folder and the Web Application is running in **medium** trust, then the Syncfusion assemblies will run in medium trust.

Essential Calculate allows working in medium trust by using following assemblies.
