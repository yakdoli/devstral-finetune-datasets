## Essential Calculate

For rectangular business objects, implementing an ICalcData interface lets you use values from your object in calculations. This section illustrates the process of adding calculation support to an Array.

### 3.5.3.1 ICalcData

1. In Visual Studio, use File | New | Project to create a new Windows Forms Application. Right-click the References in Solution Explorer and add a reference to Syncfusion.Calculate.Base.

2. As you drop the controls on the form, accept the default names so that you can copy and paste the code snippets later in this lesson.

3. The form has two buttons: the first is the Generate Data button and the second is the Set button. Drop a text box on the form and set its MultiLine property to True so that you can size it to occupy most of the form.

4. Drop the final three text boxes in left to right order under the Generate Data button, adding three labels to identify these text boxes.
