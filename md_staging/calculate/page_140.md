# Essential Calculate

This section discusses the Parse function available for the CalcEngine.

## Content

### CalcEngine.Parse Method

The `CalcEngine.Parse` method does the following:

- Accepts a string formula, for example `= A2 + 5`.
- Checks whether it is a valid formula that CalcEngine can understand.
- Returns a string that represents a parsed version of the formula that can be more readily computed.

The parsed formula is a Reverse Polish Notation expression using tokens to compactly represent the entered formula. The parsing recognizes and replaces NamedRanges with their corresponding value. The parsing also recognizes library functions and tokenizes them as well.

### 4.6.3 Calculating

This section discusses the Calculate function available for the CalcEngine.

`CalcEngine.Calculate` is the method that actually performs calculations. It does the following:

- It accepts a parsed formula.
- Uses a stack-oriented calculation technique to convert the parsed formula into the value that it represents.

#### Note

The value returned is a string holding the computed quantity.

### 4.6.4 How Things Work

1. **What happens when you enter the formula `= A1 + 5` into a cell in a `CalcSheet` object?**

2. **Explanation of Data Handling**
   
   Here letâ€™s assume that `CalcSheet` is using its own internal data storage to hold values, so that it makes it simple to understand what is going on within `CalcEngine`. If the data is being held in some other object (like a DataGrid with a DataTable datasource), things will look the same from within the `CalcEngine`.

3. **Processing Steps**
   
   Here is a sketch of the major steps taken within the library code when you enter a formula into a cell assuming `CalcEngine.UseDependencies` is `True`. The actual processing is more involved; these steps should give you an outline of what happens:
