# Essential Calculate

## Syntax

SumXmY2( array1, array2 )

where,
- array1 and array are two ranges or arrays.

## 4.7.163 SUMX2MY2

### Overview

Returns the sum of the difference of squares of corresponding values in two arrays.

### Syntax

SUMX2MY2(array_x, array_y)

#### where:
- `array_x` is the first array or range of values.
- `array_y` is the second array or range of values.

### Remarks

- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.
- The equation for the sum of the difference of squares is:

\[
\text{SUMX2MY2} = \sum (x^2 - y^2)
\]

## 4.7.164 SUMX2PY2

### Overview

Returns the sum of the sum of squares of corresponding values in two arrays. The sum of the sum of squares is a common term in many statistical calculations.

### Syntax

- [The syntax for SUMX2PY2 is not fully provided in the image. Please refer to the complete documentation for full details.]
