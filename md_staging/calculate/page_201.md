# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- Explains usable functions in numerical calculations.
- Focuses on logical operations, date and time, and financial calculations.

## Content

### 4.7.112 NOT
Reverses the value of its argument.

**Syntax**
```
NOT(logical)
```
where:
- `logical` is a value or expression that can be evaluated to `True` or `False`.

### 4.7.113 NOW
Returns the serial number of the current date and time.

**Syntax**
```
NOW( )
```

**Remarks**
- Dates are stored as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1 and January 1, 2008 is serial number 39448 because it is 39,448 days after January 1, 1900.
- Numbers to the right of the decimal point in the serial number represent the time; numbers to the left represent the date. For example, the serial number .5 represents the time 12:00 noon.

### 4.7.114 NPER
Returns the number of periods for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

**Syntax**
