# Overview

This section covers information on Essential Calculate, its key features, prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers, and finally the documentation details complementary with the product. It comprises the following subsections:

## 1.1 Introduction to Essential Calculate

Essential Calculate is a 100% Native .NET library that provides calculation functionality by using the Microsoft .NET framework, so that it can be used in any .NET environment, including C#, VB.NET, and managed C++. Essential Calculate is a UI independent class library that lets you add formula calculation support to Windows Forms, Web Forms, and WPF applications. Essential Calculate does not depend on Microsoft Excel and thus allows you to perform calculations independent of Excel.

The range of calculations includes simple algebraic expressions such as `(1.2^3-1)/8`, to formulas using intrinsic functions like `4 * sqrt(exp(8.4))`, to formulas relying on variables that are defined through controls on a form such as `cos([textBox1] * pi()/180)`, to spreadsheet-like formulas such as `Sum(A2:B14)`. Essential Calculate lets you parse and compute such expressions and includes a library of more than 150 functions. This function library is easily extendable. The data used in the calculations can be from any source, ranging from fixed values to values that are entered through the controls, to data tables and Excel spreadsheets.

Essential Calculate allows you to add extensive calculation support to your business objects. It enables you to easily set up forms that have calculation dependencies among various controls.
