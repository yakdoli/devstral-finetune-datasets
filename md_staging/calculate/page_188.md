# Essential Calculate

## Overview
- Functions to determine the length of a text string.
- Calculating logarithms of a number with various bases.
- Returning the base-10 logarithm of a number.
- Exploring other logarithmic functions.

## Content

### Len(text)

Where:
- **text** is the text string whose length is to be determined.

#### 4.7.89 LOG

Returns the logarithm of a number to the base that you specify.

**Syntax**

```
LOG(number, base)
```

Where:
- **number** is the positive real number for which, you want the logarithm.
- **base** is the base of the logarithm. If base is omitted, it is assumed to be 10.

#### 4.7.90 LOG10

Returns the base-10 logarithm of a number.

**Syntax**

```
LOG10(number)
```

Where:
- **number** is the positive real number for which, you want the base-10 logarithm.

#### 4.7.91 LOGEST
