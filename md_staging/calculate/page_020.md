### Windows Forms

#### Essential Calculate Overview
Essential Calculate is a class library that lets you add formula calculation support to both Window Forms and Web Forms applications. Essential Calculate does not depend upon Microsoft Excel and thus allows you to perform calculations independent of Excel. The range of calculations runs from simple algebraic expressions such as `(1.2^3-1)/8`, to formulas using intrinsic functions like `4 * sqrt(exp(3.4))`, to formulas relying on variables that are defined through controls on a form such as `cos([textBox1] * PI / 180)`, to spreadsheet-like formulas such as `sum(A2:B14)`. Essential Calculate lets you parse and compute such expressions and includes a library of more than 150 functions. This function library is easily extendable. The data used in the calculations can be from any source, ranging from fixed values, to values that are entered through controls, to data tables and Excel spreadsheets.
