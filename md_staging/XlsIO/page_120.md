### Number Formatting in Excel

#### Figure: Number Formatting in Excel

A number format consists of up to 4 items, separated by semicolons. Each of the items is an individual number format. The first, by default, applies to positive numbers, the second to negative numbers, the third to zeros, and the fourth to text. If you don't apply any special formatting to text, Excel uses the 'General' number format, which basically means anything that will fit.

### Long Numbers

You can make long numbers easier to read by inserting a thousands separator (a comma for US regional settings). The `#, ##0` number format is used. This format does not allow Excel to use the shorter scientific format, so the longest numbers merely show `########`, signifying that they don't fit in their cells. You can either **auto fit** the column or specify the column width in order to avoid showing `########`.

### Hide Zeros

Excel allows to hide zero values from displaying, when the user is not interested to show the values if it is "0". This can be done by setting custom format as **General** or **0.00**.
