## Excel 2007 New Formatting Features

### Overview

- Excel 2007 introduces **new formatting** to highlight cells when certain constraints are met.
- Three new visualizations: **Data Bars**, **Color Scales**, and **Icon Sets** help in exploring large datasets, identifying trends and exceptions, and quickly comparing data.

### Data Bars

**Data Bars** allow users to create visual effects to compare values in a dataset by drawing a bar in each cell that represents the value relative to other cells in the selected range.

### How Data Bars Work

Excel compares the values in the selected cells and draws a data bar in each cell to represent the relative value compared to the other cells. This makes it easier for users to identify larger and smaller values in a range.

### Setting Data Bar Formats

MS Excel enables setting these formats through the **Conditional Formatting** menu. Users can also set the criteria using the **New Formatting Rule** dialog box.
