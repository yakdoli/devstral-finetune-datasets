## Overview

- This page provides a comparison of features between different Excel file formats (`xls`, `xlsx`), focusing on their capabilities for reading, writing, and preserving various elements.
- It highlights the differences and similarities in handling specific Excel elements like Autofilter, Data validation, Comments, and Macros across the file formats.
- The table also includes information on converting from `xls` to `xlsx`, indicating which features are preserved during conversion.

### Feature Support in Excel File Formats

The following table details the support for various Excel features in different file formats:

| Element                              | xls                                | xlsx                                | xlsx to xlsx |

### Key Features Comparison

- **Autofilter, Data validation, Template marker, and Outlines**: These features are consistently supported across `xls`, `xlsx`, and during conversion from `xls` to `xlsx`.
- **Comments**: While fully supported in both `xls` and `xlsx`, the `xlsx` format only supports comments in a partial manner.
- **Freeze pane and split pane**: These features are supported in both file formats and preserved during the conversion process.
- **Macros**: Macros are not supported in `xls` or `xlsx`, but they are preserved if present in the source `xls` file during conversion.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: These features are partially supported, specifically for the default encryption, in both `xls` and `xlsx` formats.

### Implications of Conversion from `xls` to `xlsx`

- **Preservation of features**: The conversion process ensures that most features are preserved, especially those that are commonly used like Autofilter, Data validation, and Freeze pane.
- **Limitations**: Complex features such as Macros are not supported in `xlsx` and are therefore not preserved during conversion.
- **Partial support**: Features like Comments are preserved but in a reduced capacity when converting between the two file formats.

### Notes on Feature Support

- Certain features like Template marker and Outlooks are consistently supported across both file types.
- The `xlsx` format, being newer, generally aligns more closely with modern standards but may not support some legacy features found in `xls`.
