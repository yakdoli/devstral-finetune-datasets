## Essential XlsIO

### Overview
- Add the following assemblies as references in the application.
  - Syncfusion.core.dll
  - Syncfusion.compression.dll
  - Syncfusion.XlsIO.base.dll

**Note:** There is no toolbox support for XlsIO in WPF application.

Essential XlsIO is now deployed in the WPF application.

### Creating and Adding an Excel Document (With Worksheets) to the Application

Following steps will guide you to create and add XlsIO document to this application:

1. Add the following C# code to import the Syncfusion.XlsIO namespace:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;
```

The Syncfusion.XlsIO namespace is imported.

2. Create an instance of XlsIO using the following code:

```csharp
// New instance of XlsIO is created. [Equivalent to launching MS Excel with no workbooks open].
// The instantiation process consists of two steps.

// Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
```

```vb
' New instance of XlsIO is created. [Equivalent to launching MS Excel with no workbooks open].
' The instantiation process consists of two steps.

' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()
```

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
- If the body contains a local Table of Contents for this page, keep it as a bullet/numbered list with links/text as shown. Do not create links that donâ€™t exist.
- Ignore global site TOC or breadcrumbs unless the page explicitly describes them.

## Cross References
- Add See also: bullet list of explicit links/texts present on the page. Do not fabricate.

## RAG Annotations
- At the end, add an HTML comment with tags and keywords derived ONLY from visible content:
  <!-- tags: [product, module, control, api, version?] keywords: [k1, k2, ...] -->
 - Add optional per-section anchors as HTML comments before each H2/H3 to aid chunking, using IDs derived from the heading (kebab-case), e.g., <!-- anchor: XlsIO#page_043#getting-started -->. Do not add if the heading text is unclear.
