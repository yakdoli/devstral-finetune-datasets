## Content

### Orientation

- **While creating small worksheets**, it is not necessary to change the direction/orientation of the pages, but some worksheets and charts require the width of the pages to be greater than its length.

- **Similar to the landscape painting**, whose width is greater than the length, Landscape page orientation enables you to fit wider items on a page. A page, whose width is greater than the length, is called a Portrait orientation, like portraits of people.

- **Excel allows to change the orientation of the page**, through the Page Setup dialog box. It allows to change the orientation to Landscape or Portrait.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

## API Reference (if applicable)

  worksheet.PageSetup.Orientation = Orientation.Landscape;
  ```
