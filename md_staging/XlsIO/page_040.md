### Deployment Dependencies and Notes

#### 1. Application with Essential XlsIO Deployment Requirements
- The application using Essential XlsIO requires the following dependent assemblies:
  - Syncfusion.Core.dll
  - Syncfusion.Compression.Base.dll
  - Syncfusion.XlsIO.Base.dll
- Ensure all assemblies are built from the same version to avoid errors.
- Missing the `Compression.Base` assembly will raise an `Application Exception - TypeInitialization` error.

### 3. Data Files

#### Security and Permissions
- If working with XML, MDB, or other data files, ensure they have sufficient security permissions.
- Authenticated users should have full control over files and directories to allow ASP.NET code to open files at runtime.

#### JavaScript Files in ASPX Page
- The following JavaScript files should be added in the ASPX page:
  - `jquery-1.3.2.min.js`
  - `MicrosoftAjax.js`

#### Adding JavaScript Files
The above-mentioned script files are added by using the following code:

```html
<script src="<%= Url.Content("~/Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js") %>" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="<%= Url.Content("~/Scripts/MicrosoftAjax.js") %>" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

#### Deployment Completion
With this step, the process of deploying XlsIO in the ASP.NET application gets completed.
