### About XlsIO

Essential XlsIO is a .NET library that can read and write Microsoft Excel files. It features a full-fledged object model just like the Microsoft Office COM library, built entirely in C#. It can be used on systems that do not have Microsoft Excel installed, making it an excellent reporting engine for tabular data.

## API Reference

For detailed API information, refer to the Syncfusion documentation for XlsIO.

## Code Examples

```csharp
// Example of using XlsIO to create and save an Excel file
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;

// Create a new workbook
IWorkbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Open the workbook in Excel file format
workbook.Open("Sample.xlsx");

// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Set the value of a cell
worksheet.Cells[0, 0].Value = "Hello, World!";

// Save the workbook
workbook.Save("Output.xlsx");

// Close the workbook
workbook.Close();
```
