### 4.1.1.3 Number Formatting

Number Formats are little code that help you control the appearance of numbers in the Excel. A number in a cell is displayed depending on the number format applied to it. The same number can be displayed in different formats also. For example, 1.5 might represent a half teaspoon in one spreadsheet, while the same 1.5 would represent somebody's age, another spreadsheet's percentage, or so on.

Microsoft Excel recognizes the numbers in various formats: Accounting, Scientific, Fractions, and Currency. MS Excel allows to set these number formats by using the Number tab in the Format Cells dialog box.

### Explanation of Alignment Settings

The image displays various alignment settings applied to different cells in an Excel spreadsheet. Each setting is labeled with its respective alignment type (horizontal and vertical alignment) and additional attributes such as indentation and text direction.

- **HAlignFill & VAlignCenter**: Text is aligned to fill the entire cell with a vertical center alignment.
- **HAlignRight & VAlignTop**: Text is right-aligned horizontally and top-aligned vertically.
- **HAlignCenterAcrossSection & VAlignDistributed**: Text is centered across the section with distributed vertical alignment.

### Number Formatting in Excel

The text discusses the importance of number formatting in Excel. It highlights how the same numerical value (e.g., 1.5) can have different meanings depending on the context or format applied. This reinforces the need for appropriate number formatting to ensure clarity and correctness in data representation.

#### Recognized Formats
- **Accounting**: For financial reporting, currencies, etc.
- **Scientific**: For scientific notation and large numerical values.
- **Fractions**: For representing values in fractional form.
- **Currency**: For monetary values with specific formatting.

#### Setting Number Formats
MS Excel provides a dialog box under "Format Cells" where number formats can be set using the "Number" tab. This allows users to apply specific formatting to numbers to meet their display requirements.
