### New Formatting Rule Dialog Box
The *New Formatting Rule* dialog box provides various options to apply formatting rules based on cell values. Here's an overview of the options:

#### Select a Rule Type:
- **Format all cells based on their values**
- **Format only cells that contain**
- **Format only top or bottom ranked values**
- **Format only values that are above or below average**
- **Format only unique or duplicate values**
- **Use a formula to determine which cells to format**

#### Edit the Rule Description:
- When selecting "Format all cells based on their values," you can use options like *2-Color Scale* to visually represent data values.

#### Preview:
The dialog allows you to preview how the formatting will appear, using a color scale ranging from "Minimum" to "Maximum." For example:
- **Minimum**: Lowest Value (Orange)
- **Maximum**: Highest Value (Yellow)

#### Key Features:

## Icon Sets

Icon Sets give you an opportunity to create visual effects in your data, to see how the value of a cell compares with other cells. Excel 2007 offers several choices of icon sets. You can choose the icons that are most appropriate for the data you are using. Icon sets come in three sizes, so as you increase or decrease the font size, the icon becomes larger or smaller, appropriately.
