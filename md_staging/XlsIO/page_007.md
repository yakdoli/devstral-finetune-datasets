## 1.1 Introduction to Essential XlsIO

Essential XlsIO is a 100% native .NET library that generates fully functional Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets in native Excel format without depending on Microsoft Excel. Essential XlsIO is a perfect solution for the users who need to read and write Microsoft Excel files. It does not require MS Excel to be installed in the Report generation machine or server.

Essential XlsIO library can be used in any .NET environment including C#, VB.NET and managed C++. It is a Non-UI component that can be used in ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF and Silverlight applications, without any change in the API. The usage is common for all the environments, except for the part where the created spreadsheet is saved to disk or stream in the case of a Windows Forms/WPF application and streamed to the client browser in the case of Web applications; there are no temporary Excel files created on the server in an ASP.NET application. Essential XlsIO comes with support for working with formulas in the cells and provides data and worksheet manipulation support. It is known for its high performance for generating Excel files with large number of rows and columns. It is possible to create and modify Excel charts inside a workbook and also has options to secure its contents.

XlsIO can read and write Excel files that are compatible with Excel 97 to Excel 2010. The same Excel file created by using XlsIO can be opened by the following versions of MS Excel. There is no need to create separate files for different versions of Excel.

- Excel 97 (.xls)
- Excel 2000 (.xls)
- Excel 2002 (.xls)
