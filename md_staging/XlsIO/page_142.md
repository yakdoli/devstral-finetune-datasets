### Conditional Formatting

#### Overview
- Conditional formatting dynamically formats cell contents based on values.
- Allows defining and applying formatting to cells, text, and numbers based on specific criteria.
- Useful for highlighting overtime in time sheets or tracking top sales employees based on quotas.

#### Content

Conditional formatting is a feature by which the contents of a cell are dynamically formatted, based on a value. It allows you to define and apply formatting to some cells, text, and numbers, based on the criteria that is set. For example, you can format a time sheet, to point out the overtime obtained by the employee. You can also use it to track the best sales employees in a company, by setting a quota that makes a cell range particular.

In MS Excel, click the **Format** menu and then click **Conditional Formatting**. You can use any criteria of your choice. The formatting can be applied to cells' values or a particular formula.

#### Notes

- However, this restriction is removed in Excel 2007 formats.
