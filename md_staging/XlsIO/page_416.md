### Password Protection for Excel Workbooks

#### Figure 156: Entering Password to Modify

**Note:** Password protection of a workbook file is different from the workbook structure and window protection that you can set in the Protect Workbook dialog box.

#### Read-Only Recommended
This option will prompt read-only recommendation when users open the file, reminding them that the data is important and should not be changed. This can be set with or without requiring a password to open the file.

### Code Example

Following code example illustrates how to encrypt an Excel workbook with password to open, modify, and set the read-only option.

```csharp
