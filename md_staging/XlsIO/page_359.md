# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to sort a range of cells dynamically during runtime.
- Explains the process with code samples.
- Focuses on sorting the column 'ID' in descending order in a sample Excel document.

## Content

### 4.5.3.2 Sorting Data by Cell Values

This section is used to sort a range of cells dynamically, at runtime. This is explained in the following code samples:

**Figure: Sorting Example in Excel**
![](output.xlsx - Microsoft Excel)

The image shows an Excel spreadsheet titled "output.xlsx" where the column "ID" is sorted in descending order. The spreadsheet contains the following columns and data:

- **Column Titles**
  - ID
  - Name
  - DOJ (Date of Joining)
  - Salary

- **Sorted Data**
  - ID: 59653 → 28785
  - Names: Francisco Chang, Yoshi Tannamuri, José Pedro Freyre, etc.
  - DOJ: Various dates from 1/14/2001 to 10/3/2012.
  - Salary: Various amounts from $7,677.00 to $55,078.00.

Column "ID" is Sorted in Descending order.

### Implementation Details

The sorting functionality is demonstrated in the context of a C# application, as part of a larger application or library, likely utilizing Syncfusion's XlsIO component. The focus is on dynamically sorting a specific column in an Excel worksheet.

## Code Examples

```csharp
// (Code example not explicitly provided here)
// The implementation would likely involve:
// 1. Opening an existing Excel workbook or creating a new one.
// 2. Selecting the specific range or column to be sorted.
// 3. Applying the sorting functionality, either ascending or descending, on the specified column.
// An example could look like this:

// Step 1: Create or open an Excel document
IApplication application = new Application();
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("input.xlsx");

// Step 2: Access the specific worksheet
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Step 3: Sort the column
worksheet.Range["A4:H26"].SortAscending("A4:A26", true);

// Step 4: Save or close the workbook
workbook.SaveAs("output.xlsx");
workbook.Close();
application.Quit();
```
