## Essential XlsIO

### 4.6.2.3 Edit Range

Excel also allows the user to set the permission for a range of cells, for modification, when the worksheet is protected. This can be enabled by using the **Protection** tab in the **Format Cell** dialog box. This option enables the user to remove the restriction for a range of cells, and enter/modify values in it.

XlsIO allows to unlock a range of cells by using the **Locked** property of **IRange**.

For more details, see **Lock Cells**.

### 4.7 View

Excel provides multiple options to set the view for workbooks/worksheets, to allow users to get a clear perspective of large worksheets.

This section explains how the below features can be implemented through XlsIO.

- **Window** - This topic explains how various settings can affect the window of the Excel spreadsheet.
- **Zoom** - This topic explains how to apply zooming by using XlsIO.
- **Show/Hide** - This topic explains how to show/hide grid lines and headings in the worksheet.
- **Macros** - This topic explains the support provided by XlsIO with respect to VBA Macros.

#### 4.7.1 Window

This section elaborates on the following features of Excel that control the display of worksheets.

##### 4.7.1.1 FreezePane

It is difficult to read and understand very large spreadsheets. When you scroll too far to the right or down, you will not be able to view the headings that are located at the top and at the left side of the worksheet. Without the headings, it's hard to keep track of the columns or rows of data you are currently viewing.
