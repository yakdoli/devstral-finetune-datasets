### 4.2.6 Pivot Tables

Pivot Tables is an Excel feature that helps in summarizing large data. Instead of analyzing rows upon rows of records, a pivot table can aggregate your data and show a new perspective with few clicks. You can also move columns to rows or vice versa. You can create the table by defining which fields to view, and how the data should be displayed. Based on the field selections, Excel aggregates and organizes the data so that you can see a different view of your data.
