### 4.7 How to Implement Localization Support

**Overview:**
- Syncfusion Essential Studio products allow customizing applications for specific languages and cultures of a particular country or region.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Ensure that your Syncfusion WPF application can support localization.

#### 4.7.1 WPF

**Description:**
- Provide details on how to set up localization for WPF applications using Syncfusion controls and APIs.

**Steps:**
- **Setup:** Configure the localization resource files and the language settings in your application.
- **Usage:** Apply localization to Syncfusion controls by specifying the appropriate resource culture.
- **Testing:** Validate the localized application to ensure all controls and text are displayed correctly in the selected language.

**Example Code:**
```csharp
// Example of setting up the default language
System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US");
```

**Note:** Ensure that the resource files are correctly named and placed in the appropriate directory for each supported language.
