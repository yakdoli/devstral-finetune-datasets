### Licensing Issues and Resolution

This message appears because the `.exe.licenses` file shown in the following screenshot has been modified to include the Syncfusion licensing information. To embed this information into the output exe, the user needs to rebuild the application. Verify whether this file has the Syncfusion version information for which the user has the license. If the file has information for any other version, the **Licensing Error** message will open every time the user runs the application.

### Resolving the Licensing Issues for the latest Syncfusion versions (Applicable to all Syncfusion versions from 8.2.0.x):
