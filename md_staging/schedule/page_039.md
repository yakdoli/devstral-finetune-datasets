3.4 **Data used by ScheduleControl**

There are generally two types of data required by ScheduleControl. Most of the data is what we described as **Appointments data**. This data includes the time, subject, body, and so on, of each of the actual appointments.

The second type of data we refer to as the **DropLists data**. This data consists of the several option lists that go into describing the actual appointment data. For example, each appointment may have a marker associated with it that indicates something of the nature of the appointment like whether it is business, personal, a must-attend, etc. This second type of data is more like schema data, as it suggests the content options of the actual Appointments data.
