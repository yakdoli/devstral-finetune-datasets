## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

### Overview

The NavigationCalendar object is docked at the top of this panel. There is also a Splitter docked under the Navigation Calendar that allows you to display more or fewer calendars in the NavigationCalendar. The default setting displays two such calendars.

- **Navigation Calendar**: A GridControl-derived object that displays multiple calendars, allowing you to select the dates displayed in the Schedule control. This calendar is docked at the top of the NavigationPanel. The number of calendars displayed is determined by its client height. Enlarging the height of the Navigation Calendar will display more calendars. There is a Splitter docked under the Navigation Calendar to facilitate such sizing.

- **Schedule Grid**: A Grid control-derived object that displays the actual schedule content, i.e., the appointments for the various dates. The actual look of this Grid control is determined by the `ScheduleViewType`, which is set by using the `ScheduleControl.ScheduleType` property. You can have both timed and untimed (all-day) appointments using this Schedule control. The `ScheduleControl` is easily localized and can display customizable alerts.
