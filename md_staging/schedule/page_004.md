# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## 1 Overview

This section covers information on Essential Schedule control, its key features, and prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers, and finally the documentation details complementary with the product. It comprises the following sub sections:

## 1.1 Introduction to Essential Schedule

Syncfusion Essential Schedule is a Windows Forms class library built around the functionality that is found in the Windows Forms Grid control. The control allows you to add scheduling support to your applications. The scheduling support includes creating new appointments, displaying these appointments in a variety of views, including Monthly, Daily, Weekly, Work Week and multiple days. In the daily formats, you can use the UI to drag appointments to another time slot and to extend appointments. A flexible navigation calendar lets you easily home in on the dates you would like to see in the Schedule control.

The data displayed in the Schedule control is provided through any object that implements the IScheduleDataProvider interface that is defined in the library. Included in the library is one concrete implementation based on the ArrayList that uses disk files to persist the data. With this implementation, you can easily have several schedule files that can either be treated as individual schedules or merged to be treated as a single schedule.
