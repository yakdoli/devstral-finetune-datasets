#### WorkWeek View

Notice in the WorkWeek view snapshot below, there is a Vacation entry at the top of 10/31/2006. This entry is an All-Day entry which has no specific time assigned to it. It is simply associated with the particular date. For the Day, WorkWeek, and Custom views, All-Day entries are displayed in a frozen row at the top of the ScheduleGrid. For Week and Month views, All-Day entries are listed with the time entries.

### All-Day Entry Display

- **Day, WorkWeek, Custom Views**: All-Day entries are displayed in a frozen row at the top of the ScheduleGrid.
