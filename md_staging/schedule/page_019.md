# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## ScheduleGrid

- **ScheduleGrid**: This is a GridControl-derived object that displays the actual schedule content, i.e., the appointments for the various dates. The actual look of this GridControl is determined by the ScheduleViewType, which is set by using the ScheduleControl.ScheduleType property.

### Adding Controls Under NavigationCalendar

Here is a Day view that shows a panel added under the NavigationCalendar by using the `ScheduleControl1.AddControlToNavigationPanel` code mentioned above.

- You can dock any control under the NavigationCalendar by using this method.

### Additional Views

In addition to the Month view, the ScheduleControl can also display Day, WorkWeek, Week, and Custom views.
