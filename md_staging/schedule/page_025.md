# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

In this lesson, you will create a sample Windows Forms application, drop a ScheduleControl onto a form and then hook it up to a SimpleScheduleDataProvider object to serialize schedule items (appointments) to a disk file. Along the way, you will see how to change properties of the ScheduleControl and also serialize these changed settings to a disk file as well. Other tasks discussed in this tutorial are how to use the built-in functionality to add new schedule items, modify existing schedule items and other common tasks.

## Overview
