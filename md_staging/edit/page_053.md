### 4.3.2 AutoReplace Triggers

The Edit Control comes with the AutoReplace Triggers feature, which allows the control to automatically correct some of the known predefined typing errors. AutoReplace Triggers are fired when certain keys are pressed. These keys are defined within the language definition. When the AutoReplace Trigger key is pressed, the editor checks the word before the AutoReplace Trigger to see if it is in the AutoReplace table. If it is present, then the word is automatically replaced with its replacement word.

The AutoReplace Trigger keys are defined within the language definitions. This means that different keys can be defined as triggers for different languages.

        fro|
    }
}
```
