## Printing

The Edit Control provides complete support for printing its contents. You can either print the entire document, just the current page, specific pages, or selected text. The printing implementation is very similar to the one available in standard applications such as MS Office or Visual Studio.NET. A Print dialog box provides options to customize the printer settings, number of copies, the pages to be printed, and so on. Edit Control also includes a Print Preview feature that allows you to view the document before printing. Moreover, features like customizable header and footer are also available in Essential Edit.

In brief, the printing functionality of the Edit Control supports the following features.

- Print Preview
- Custom Header and Footer Text
- Document Name
- Page Numbers
- Content Dividers
- Wordwrap
- Color Printing to preserve Syntax Highlighting
- Selected Text Printing
- Line Numbers
- Printing a Specific Page or Set of Pages
- Printing Entire Document
- Creating a Printer Document
- Current Page Printing
- Printer Dialog
- Outlining Blocks

You can invoke the Print dialog box by using the `Print` method of the Edit Control, as shown in the below code snippet.
