## 4.7.2 Schema Definition File for XML Syntax Coloring Configuration File

Essential Edit now comes with an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file that provides schema information for the XML language definition syntax. The main advantage of this is, just by including this XSD file along with the XML Syntax Coloring Configuration file in the Visual Studio .NET project, the member list drop-down will be displayed while the elements in the XML Syntax Coloring Configuration file are edited in the Visual Studio Code Editor.
