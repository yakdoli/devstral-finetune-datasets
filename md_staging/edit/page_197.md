## Essential Edit for Windows Forms

### Handling File or Stream Closing Actions

```vb
[VB.NET]

Private Sub editControl1_Closing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Edit.StreamCloseEventArgs) Handles editControl1.StreamClose
    ' Cancel the file or stream closing action.
    e.Action = SaveChangesAction.Cancel
    
    ' Close the file or stream without saving the unsaved contents; the changes will be lost forever.
    e.Action = SaveChangesAction.Discard
    
    ' Silently saves the unsaved contents to the currently open file or stream. If the contents have not been saved to a file or stream as yet, the Save Changes prompt is displayed.
    e.Action = SaveChangesAction.Save
    
    ' Displays the default Save Changes prompt if there are unsaved contents when the file or stream is closed.
    e.Action = SaveChangesAction.ShowDialog
End Sub
```

**Note:** The default value of `e.Action` is `SaveChangesAction.ShowDialog`.

| Edit Control Method | Description |
