The following topics are covered under this section:

##### 4.3.1 AutoComplete Support

Complete Word feature is a user-friendly functionality that can be used in conjunction with the Context Choice, and is analogous to the Complete Word feature in Visual Studio. This feature autocompletes the rest of the member name once you have entered enough characters to distinguish it. Type the first few letters of the member name, and then press `ALT+RIGHT ARROW` or `CTRL+SPACEBAR` keys to see this functionality.

#### Example

When the following text is typed - `this.editControl1.`, it displays a Context Choice list with members in the following order:

- New
- Word
- WordLeft
- WordRight

##### Case 1

If you type "w" after `this.editControl1.`, such that it looks like - `this.editControl1.w`, and press the `ALT+RIGHT ARROW` (or `CTRL+SPACEBAR`) keys, it will autocomplete it with the first matching member name. In this case, it will be autocompleted as `this.editControl1.Word`.

##### Case 2
