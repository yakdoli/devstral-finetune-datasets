## 4.2.5 Regular Expressions

Non-Deterministic Finite Automation (NFA) regular expressions are a powerful way of parsing text and are used in a wide range of products like the Microsoft .NET platform, Perl, Python, Grep (Global Regular Expression Print), VI Editor, Tcl, Awk, and various shells. Regular expressions figure into all kinds of text-manipulation tasks like searching, search-replace, and can also be used to test for certain conditions in a text file or data stream.

Edit Control implements a customized regular expression engine which is capable of parsing extremely complicated languages including embedded scripts. The search and search-replace functionalities also use the regular expressions internally.

### Language Elements

Edit Control offers complete support to a variety of common constructs for regular expression patterns. Refer to the **Language Elements** topic for more information on the regular expression pattern syntax.

### Lexical Macros

Lexical macros definitions create named regular expressions that can be used to replace certain sections of the regular expression patterns. This improves the reusability of common patterns and simplifies the task of creating lexemes in configuration files. Refer to the **Lexical Macros** topic for more information in this regard.

### Regular Expressions in XML based Configuration File

There are certain regular expression command characters that must be translated to an XML compatible format while being used in an XML-based configuration file. The following is an example of a lexem tag block that has been used for outlining.

```xml
<lexem 
    BeginBlock="#region" 
    EndBlock="#end region" 
    Type="PreprocessorKeyword" 
    IsEndRegex="true" 
    IsComplex="true" 
    IsCollapsable="true" 
    AutoNameExpression="\s*(?&lt;text&gt;.*).*\n" 
    AutoNameTemplate="${text }"
/>
```
