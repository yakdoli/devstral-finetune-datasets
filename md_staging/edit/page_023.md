#### Essential Edit Overview
Essential Edit is designed to be an extensible and easy-to-use syntax highlighting Edit Control, equipped with a powerful set of features such as syntax highlighting, undo/redo actions, Visual Studio.NET style collapsible editing, easy configuration, and more features. Essential Edit is closely modeled on the Visual Studio.NET editor and it incorporates almost all its features.

Essential Edit supports custom configuration files, and hence you can syntax highlight any piece of code or text according to any desired highlighting settings.

This section covers the following:

#### 4.1 Configuration Settings

**Overview**: Essential Edit is built to be flexible and easy-to-use with careful design and implementation. To configure Essential Edit for an application, only a configuration file is needed. The configuration settings contain sections that control various customizations such as rendering colors for keywords, token-based segments for comments, strings, and more.

It comprises the following topics:

#### 4.1.1 Creating a Custom Language Configuration File

**Overview**: This section explains how to create a custom language configuration file for Essential Edit. The following code snippet illustrates a sample XML-based configuration file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ArrayOfConfigLanguage>
    <ConfigLanguage name="default_language">
        <formats>
            <format name="Text" Font="Courier New, 10pt" FontColor="Black" />
            <format name="SelectedText" Font="Courier New, 10pt" BackColor="Highlight" FontColor="HighlightText" />
        </formats>
    </ConfigLanguage>
</ArrayOfConfigLanguage>
```

### Notes
- The configuration file defines the rendering and formatting options for different text elements, such as regular text and selected text.
- The `name` attribute specifies the format name, while `Font`, `FontColor`, and `BackColor` define the visual appearance.
- This setup allows for customized styling of the text displayed in the Essential Edit control.
