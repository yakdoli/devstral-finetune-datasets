## Assertions

| Assertion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ^         | Specifies that the match must occur at the beginning of the string or the beginning of the line. |
| $         | Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the string, before \n at the end of the string, or at the end of the line. |
| \A        | Specifies that the match must occur at the beginning of the document. |
| \z        | Specifies that the match must occur at the end of the document. |
| \b        | Specifies that the match must occur on a boundary between \w (alphanumeric) and \W (nonalphanumeric) characters. |
| \B        | Specifies that the match must not occur on a \b boundary. |
| (?= )     | Zero-width positive look ahead assertion. Continues match only if the subexpression matches at this position on the right. For example, \_(?=\w) matches an underscore followed by a word character, without matching the word character. |
| (?! )     | Zero-width negative look ahead assertion. Continues match only if the subexpression does not match at this position on the right. For example, \b(?!\w+\\b matches words that do not begin with un. |

## Miscellaneous Constructs

The following table lists other regular expression constructs.

| Construct | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| " "       | Encapsulates a fixed string of characters. |
| {}        | Provides a call to a lexical macro. The use of a WordMacro (which is similar to w) would appear as {WordMacro}. |
| ()        | Provides a grouping construct that groups the contained regular expression elements and changes their precedence. |
| (?#)      | Inline comment inserted within a regular expression. The comment terminates at the first closing parenthesis character. |
| |         | Provides an alternation construct that matches any one of the terms |
