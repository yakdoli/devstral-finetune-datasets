# Essential Edit for Windows Forms

The LoadFile method loads the content of any desired file into the Edit Control.

## Loading Files

The `LoadFile` method in the Edit Control is used to load the content of a file into its control. Here is a detailed description and example usage:

### Methods and Description

| Edit Control Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LoadFile | Shows the open file dialog to the user and opens the selected file. |

#### Note
The character encoding for the text can also be specified while loading the file.

#### Example Code

**[C#]**
```csharp
// Displays the Open File dialog.
this.editControl.LoadFile();

// Loads the content of the specified file.
this.editControl.LoadFile("Temp.txt", Encoding.ASCII);
```

**[VB.NET]**
```vbnet
' Displays the Open File dialog.
Me.editControl.LoadFile()

' Loads the content of the specified file.
Me.editControl.LoadFile("Temp.txt", Encoding.ASCII)
```

## Saving Files

The following methods are used to save a file in the Edit Control.

### Save Methods and Description

| Edit Control Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SaveFile | Saves the contents of the Edit Control to a specified file. |
| Save | Invokes the save file dialog box and lets you save the contents of the Edit Control to the specified file. |
| SaveAs | Opens the SaveAs dialog and prompts you to enter the name of the file. |
| SaveModified | Saves the file only if it was modified and prompts for the filename if needed. This is especially useful when the application is about to be closed or a new file is being loaded into the Edit Control. |

#### Example Code

**[C#]**
```csharp
// Saves the contents of the file.
```
