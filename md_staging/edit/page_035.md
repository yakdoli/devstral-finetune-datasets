# Essential Edit for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The `Edit Control` uses the clipboard to perform cut, copy, and paste operations on text data.
- Data is stored in the clipboard for cut and copy operations and retrieved from the clipboard for paste operations.
- The document details the APIs in the `Edit Control` that facilitate these clipboard operations.

## Clipboard Operations in Edit Control

| **Edit Control Method** | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Copy                     | Copies the selected text contents into the clipboard.                        |
| Cut                      | Cuts the selected text contents from `Edit Control` and places it into the clipboard. |
| Paste                    | Retrieves copied contents from the clipboard and pastes it into `Edit Control`. |
| CanCopy                  | Indicates whether it is possible to perform copy operations in `Edit Control`.  |
| CanCut                   | Indicates whether it is possible to perform cut operations in `Edit Control`.   |
| CanPaste                 | Indicates whether it is possible to perform copy, cut, and paste operations in `Edit Control`. |
| ClearClipboard           | Clears all contents in the clipboard associated with Essential Edit. This is generally used immediately after the application loads, to clear any junk from previous clipboard operations. |

// Copies the selected text into the clipboard.
