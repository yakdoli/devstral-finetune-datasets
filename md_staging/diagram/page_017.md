# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## 3 Getting Started

This section helps you to understand and quickly get started using Essential Diagram in your Windows Forms applications. Control appearance and structure are defined, and the relevant classes are depicted.

### 3.1 Structure of Essential Diagram

The Essential Diagram package is comprised of the following controls:

- Diagram
- Overview
- PaletteGroupBar
- PaletteGroupView
- PropertyEditor
- DocumentExplorer

#### Diagram

The Diagram control is an interactive two-dimensional graphics control for diagramming, technical drawing, visualization, and simulation applications. It provides a surface for rendering and manipulating 2-D shapes, text, images, and Windows Form controls. The UI supports drag-and-drop, scaling, zooming, rotation, grouping, ungrouping, connection points, layouts, and many other features.

The Diagram control's architecture is composed of three objects, namely **Model**, **View**, and **Controller** and it provides a clear separation between data, visualization, and user interface. One advantage of model-view-controller architecture is that the parts are interchangeable. The model, view, and controller can be swapped in and out independently.

- **The model** contains the data (node/connector) portion of a diagram.
- **The view** is responsible for rendering the diagram.
- **The controller** handles user interaction.

The Diagram control supports both horizontal and vertical rulers.
