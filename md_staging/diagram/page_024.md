#### Figure 11: Designer Form Window Added with Diagram Control
This section illustrates the integration of the Diagram control within the Windows Forms Designer environment. Key components labeled include:

- **Diagram Control**: Shown in the Designer Window.
- **Diagram Smart Tag**: Accessible from the top bar for additional configuration options.
- **Dependent assemblies**: Highlighted in the Solution Explorer, including:
  - `Microsoft.CSharp`
  - `Syncfusion.Core`
  - `Syncfusion.Diagram.Base`
  - `Syncfusion.Diagram.Windows`
  - `Syncfusion.Shared.Base`

These assemblies are essential for enabling the Diagram functionality within the application.

#### 3.2.1.2 Creating a Diagram Control through Code
This section provides a detailed step-by-step procedure for programmatically creating a Diagram control in a .NET Windows Forms application.

##### To create a Diagram control using code:

1. **Create a new Windows Forms application.**
   - Begin by setting up a new Windows Forms project in your development environment.

2. **Add the following basic dependent Syncfusion assemblies to the project:**
   - `Syncfusion.Core.dll`
   - `Syncfusion.Diagram.Base.dll`
   - `Syncfusion.Diagram.Windows.dll`
   - `Syncfusion.Shared.Base.dll`
   - Ensure these assemblies are properly referenced to enable access to the Diagram control features.

3. **Create a Diagram control using the following code.**
   - The code will define and initialize the Diagram control programmatically, allowing for customization and integration within your application.
