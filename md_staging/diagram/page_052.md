## Content

### Dragging the DocumentExplorer Control to the Designer

The diagram shows the Toolbox in Visual Studio, highlighting the `DocumentExplorer` control. The highlighted section explains:

1. **Pointer and Diagram**: These are tools in the toolbox used for interacting with the controls.
2. **DocumentExplorer**: 
   - **Version**: 10.204.0.56 from Syncfusion Inc.
   - **.NET Component**: An overview control that provides a perspective view of the diagram model.
   - **Description**: A tool for managing and viewing the structure of a diagram within the application.

The instructions specify dragging the `DocumentExplorer` control to the designer window, as shown in the diagram with an arrow pointing towards the action.

### Figure 22: Dragging DocumentExplorer to the Designer

The DocumentExplorer control will be added to the designer, and its dependent assemblies will be added to the project once the control is dropped into the Designer Form window.

### Explanation

When you drag and drop the `DocumentExplorer` control to the design surface, it will automatically include necessary references and dependencies required for its operation in the project. This ensures that the control functions correctly without needing additional manual configuration.
