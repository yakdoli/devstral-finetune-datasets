**3.2.1.3 Adding Nodes to the Model**

The Diagram control has a list of predefined basic shapes (nodes) which help you to draw diagrams according to your requirement. You can create your own shapes by inheriting the existing shapeâ€™s class and the Symbol Designer utility tool which is shipped with the Essential Diagram package.

The following code creates a rectangular node and adds it to the model.

#### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
// Enable diagram rulers
diagram.ShowRulers = true;

// Create a rectangular node
```
