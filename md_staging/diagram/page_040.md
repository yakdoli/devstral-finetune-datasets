### Creating a PaletteGroupView Control through Designer

This section depicts the step-by-step procedure to create a PaletteGroupView control through the Visual Studio designer in a .NET Windows Forms application.

#### To create a PaletteGroupView control using the designer:

1. Create a new Windows Forms application.
2. Open the Designer Form window.
3. Drag PaletteGroupView from Toolbox and drop it to the Designer Form window.

#### Figure 18: Dragging PaletteGroupView to the designer

The PaletteGroupView control will be added to the designer and its dependent assemblies will be added to the project once you dropped it to the Designer Form window.
