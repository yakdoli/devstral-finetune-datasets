# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses layouts for directed tree structures with rotation angles.
- Two types of tree layouts are demonstrated: top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top.
- Rotation angles of 0° and 180° are used to demonstrate the effects on the layout orientation.

## Content

### Directed Tree Layouts

#### Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle
![Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle](#)
**Figure 77: Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle**

This layout shows a directed tree structure with a top-to-bottom orientation. The root node is at the top, and the nodes are arranged in a horizontal line extending from this root. Each node in the horizontal line has one or more child nodes further below, demonstrating a hierarchical relationship.

#### Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle
![Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle](#)
**Figure 78: Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle**

This layout shows a directed tree structure with a bottom-to-top orientation. The root node is at the bottom, and the nodes are arranged in a horizontal line extending upwards from this root. Each node in the horizontal line has one or more child nodes above it, creating a reverse hierarchical structure compared to the top-to-bottom layout.
