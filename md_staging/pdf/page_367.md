You can enable and disable PDF layers for customization purposes. For more information on enabling and disabling PDF layers, refer to the section [Creating and Embedding PDF Layers in the PDF document](#creating-and-embedding-pdf-layers-in-the-pdf-document).

## How To Read Conformance Level From PDF?

You can read conformance level applied to a PDF file using `PdfLoadedDocument.Conformance` property. This property will return the levels supported by `PdfConformanceLevel` enum.

Note: It will return none when the PDF file is not applied with any levels.

Following is the code snippet to read conformance level from PDF.

```csharp
PdfLoadedDocument loadedDocument = new PdfLoadedDocument(fileName);
PdfConformanceLevel appliedConformance = loadedDocument.Conformance;
```

```vb
Dim loadedDocument As New PdfLoadedDocument(fileName)
Dim appliedConformance As PdfConformanceLevel = loadedDocument.Conformance
```
