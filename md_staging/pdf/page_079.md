# Essential PDF

## Overview
- Discusses the RightToLeft property and its impact on text alignment and printing.
- Explains the use of CJK Fonts in Essential PDF and their additional requirements.
- Introduces the MeasureString method for text size calculation.
- Outlines the attributes and functionalities covered in the "Drawing" section.

### Note
- **RightToLeft property**: Does not change the text alignment. It enables the RTL engine and prints text in RTL order. Use the Alignment property of PdfStringFormat to set the horizontal alignment of the text.
- **RTL Support**: Do not enable RTL support if it is not needed, as it reduces text printing speed.

### CJK Fonts
A set of standard PDF fonts supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters. These fonts are supported through the `PdfCjkStandardFont` class. In addition to the families supported by `PdfStandardFont`, the following families are required:

- HanyangSystemsGothicMedium
- HanyangSystemsShinMyeongJoMedium
- HeiseiKakuGothicW5
- HeiseiMinchoW3
- MonotypeHeiMedium
- MonotypeSungLight
- SinoTypeSongLight

### Text Measuring
The `MeasureString` method of the `PdfFont` class calculates the size of the text, the number of lines that fit in the bounds, and the number of characters in the text.
