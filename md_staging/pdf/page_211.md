#### 4.1.7.1.1 Draw Simple text

Drawing Text in a PDF document is made simpler and similar to .NET GDI. This section demonstrates how a string is drawn in a PDF page by using Essential PDF.

The process is very similar to drawing any other object on the PDF page. The string is drawn by using the `DrawString` method of the `Graphics` class. You also need to specify the font and brush with which you want the string to be drawn.

```csharp
//Creates a new PDF document.
PdfDocument doc = new PdfDocument();

//Adds a page to the document.
PdfPage page = doc.Pages.Add();

//Creates Pdf graphics for the page
PdfGraphics g = page.Graphics;

//Creates a solid brush.
PdfBrush brush = new PdfSolidBrush(Color.Black);

//Sets the font.
PdfFont font = new PdfStandardFont(PdfFontFamily.Helvetica, fontSize);
```

## Code Examples

// Step 3: Create a graphics object for the page
PdfGraphics g = page.Graphics;

// Step 4: Set up the brush for the text
PdfBrush brush = new PdfSolidBrush(Color.Black);

// Step 5: Define the font
PdfFont font = new PdfStandardFont(PdfFontFamily.Helvetica, fontSize);

// Optional: Use the DrawString method to render the text
g.DrawString("This is a sample text", font, brush, new PointF(50, 50));
```
