### 1.1 Introduction to Essential PDF

Essential PDF is a .NET library with the capability to produce Adobe PDF files.

It does not use any external libraries and is built from scratch in C#. It can be used on the server-side (ASP.NET or any other environment) or with Windows Forms / WPF applications. The usage is common for all environments except for the part where the created document is saved to the disk or stream in case of Windows Forms / WPF applications, and streamed to the client browser in the case of ASP.NET applications.
