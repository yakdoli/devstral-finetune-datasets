## 3.4 PDF Version Compatibility

The PDF files generated by Essential PDF can be viewed using Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.x or later versions. Other conforming Readers that strictly follow Adobe's PDF specification 1.4 or later also can be used.

**Note:** Adobe Reader is free software; hence the most recent version can be downloaded easily.

Essential PDF allows you control the structure of PDF files using the FileStructure property of the document. The following settings are required to control the structure:

- **Version** (property)-Specifies the version of the PDF document.

**Note:** This property marks the file by the specified version only. It does not control the compatibility of the features used in the file.

- **CrossReferenceType** (property)-Specifies the type of the cross-reference in the file. This property allows you to present a cross-reference with a standard format, in a cross-reference table. The cross-references can also be presented as a cross-reference stream using the CrossReferenceStream property. This format is supported by the PDF 1.5 and higher versions. The files using this format are more compact, especially when compression is used. However, generating such a file takes more time.

**Note:** It is suggested that you disable this option, if file generation speed is a critical factor.

### Changing PDF Version to Enable Acrobat 5.0 Compatibility

The following code example illustrates how to change the PDF version to 1.4, which will enable reading in Acrobat 5.0.

```csharp
doc.FileStructure.CrossReferenceType =
    PdfCrossReferenceType.CrossReferenceTable;

doc.FileStructure.Version = PdfVersion.Version1_4;
```

You have successfully changed the PDF version to 1.4.
