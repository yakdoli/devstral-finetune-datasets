### PDF/X-1a

#### Overview of PDF/X-1a

PDF/X is a subset of the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) specification, which exhibits best practices in graphic arts file exchange. PDF/X-1a restricts the content in a PDF document that does not directly serve the purpose of high-quality print production output, such as annotations, Java Actions, and embedded multimedia.

PDF/X-1a also eliminates the most common errors in file preparation. Sending the document as a PDF/X-1a file will guarantee that font errors do not occur. This is because a file declared as complying with the PDF/X-1a standard meets the following requirements:

- All fonts and images must be embedded.
- All elements must be encoded as CMYK.

#### Additional Requirements

In addition,

- MediaBox and TrimBox or ArtBox must be defined; BleedBox is optional.
- The output intent must be specified either by stating a Characterized Printing Condition or identifying an ICC output profile.

#### Advantages of PDF/X-1a

By using a PDF/X-1a workflow,

- Print-ready files will reproduce as you intended.
- You will save time and money.

#### Creating a PDF/X-1a Compliant Document

The following code snippet illustrates how to create a PDF document that complies with the above standard.

```csharp
// Create the document.
PdfDocument doc = new PdfDocument(PdfConformanceLevel.Pdf_X1A2001);

// Set the color space. Should be CMYK.
doc.ColorSpace = PdfColorSpace.CMYK;

// Save and close the document.
doc.Save("sample.pdf");
```
