## PdfRadialGradientBrush

This brush is similar to the above brush, the only exception being the gradient effect. Here the gradient is not linear; it's radial. This means there are two circles with different center points and radii.

### Pen

A pen controls drawing lines and shape borders. You may specify the width, different dash patterns, and color of the pen. Optionally, you may create a pen from a brush, which allows you to use gradients in drawing lines and curves. However, you should be careful with the coordinates of the brush.

#### PdfPen Class Properties

The **PdfPen** class defines these settings for drawing. The following are the properties of this class:

| Name           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brush         | Gets or sets the brush, which specifies the pen behavior.               |
| Color         | Gets or sets the color of the pen.                                        |
| DashOffset    | Gets or sets the dash offset of the pen.                                 |
| DashPattern   | Gets or sets the dash pattern of the pen. The following dash patterns are available:<br>• Dash<br>• DashDot<br>• DashDotDot<br>• Dot<br>• Solid<br>• Custom |
| DashStyle     | Gets or sets the dash style of the pen.                                   |
| LineCap       | Gets or sets the line cap of the pen.                                    |
| LineJoin      | Gets or sets the line join style of the pen.                             |
| MiterLimit    | Gets or sets the miter limit.                                           |
| Width         | Gets or sets the width of the pen.                                       |
