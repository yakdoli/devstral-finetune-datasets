## Content

### 4.1.1.2 PDF Layers

This is a complete support for creating PDF layers, which allows creating unlimited levels of layers and sub-layers in a parent-child relationship. PDF layers provide the support for creating unlimited levels of layers and sub-layers. Through this support, the user can define optional content that can be shown or hidden by the user.

#### 4.1.1.2.1 Use Case Scenario
