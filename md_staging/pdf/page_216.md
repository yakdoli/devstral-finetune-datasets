RTF (Rich Text Format) is a standard specification for the formatting of documents. They are ASCII files with special commands to indicate formatting information such as margins and fonts.

Essential PDF supports drawing an RTF text into a PDF document by converting it as a bitmap or metafile image.

- Converting RTF text into a bitmap file provides improved performance.
- Converting RTF text into a metafile image provides high resolution and searchable text.

The following code illustrates how to draw an RTF text into bitmap and metafile formats.
