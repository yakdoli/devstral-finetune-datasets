## Essential PDF

### 4.1.2.3 Tables

Tables are useful for presenting a large quantity of information clearly and concisely. In PDF, tables are drawn as a series of rectangles with text and image correctly positioned within them. Using Essential PDF, it is drawn with the help of PdfBrush, PdfPen, and other PdfGraphics elements. Essential PDF also offers two classes to achieve them without any hassle. They are:

-  PdfLightTable
-  PdfGrid

#### PdfLightTable

It allows the creation of a table with inputs from DataTable, arrays, or any other entity class. It allows you to perform simple formatting using events. As this class allows minimal customization options, rendering will be faster than PDF Grid and is recommended to draw a simple table.

Check the following comparison table for more details.
