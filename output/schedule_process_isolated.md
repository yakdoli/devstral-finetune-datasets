# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Overview
- A prompt is displayed when closing a modified form.
- Instructions to modify Form_Load code for conditionally reloading saved data.
- New code to implement the conditional reloading logic.

## Content

### Prompt for Closing Modified Form

**Figure 26: A Prompt is displayed as you try to close the Modified Form**

![Image description](#)

The screenshot shows a prompt being displayed when the user attempts to close the modified form. The calendar displayed is for November and December 2006, with the focus on "Wednesday, 08 November 2006". There is a scheduled event labeled "Dr Appt 10:00" for 10:00 AM.

### Modify Form_Load Code

1. Next, modify our Form_Load code to conditionally reload the saved data if the file is present on the disk. Here is the new code. Copy this code to your Form1.cs file. Notice that you have added a "using" statement to reference the System.IO namespace in addition to the new code in the Form1_Load. (If you are not using the 2.0 Framework, remove the partial keyword).

### Code Example

```csharp
using System.IO; // Added this line to reference the System.IO namespace

private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Conditional code to reload saved data if the file exists
}
```

Note that you will need to implement the logic inside the `Form1_Load` method to check if the file is present on the disk and reload the saved data accordingly.

## Overview

- **Key Concepts**:
  - ScheduleData Base Classes for data interaction.
  - Utilization of IServiceProvider interfaces for providing data to ScheduleControl.
  - Pre-determined droplist settings for simplified integration.
  - Overview of ScheduleAppointment Class for managing appointments.

## Content

### 3.4.1 ScheduleData Base Classes

The ScheduleControl gets its data through its **DataSource** property, an **IScheduleDataProvider** object. So, it is this **IScheduleDataProvider** interface (and several other associated interfaces) that gives you the ability and facility to provide data to the ScheduleControl. To simplify this process of providing data, Essential Schedule also exposes these interfaces as base classes that include some pre-determine droplist settings that allow you to use the ScheduleControl with less coding work. But, you do have the option of working directly through the interfaces to construct your own data provider for the ScheduleControl.

The Essential Schedule library contains several base classes that implement the various data interfaces required by the ScheduleControl. These base classes use virtual methods which, you can override to provide a concrete data implementation. The classes in the **SimpleScheduleDataProvider** file that is shipped with the samples and used in the Tutorial section of this User Guide are derived from the ScheduleData base classes. Check out the shipped sample that uses the SimpleScheduleDataProvider as a data source for ScheduleControl.

The following sections discuss these ScheduleData base classes in more detail.

### 3.4.1.1 The Appointments Data

Here are the ScheduleData base classes that provide the Appointments data used by ScheduleControl. For code details of deriving these ScheduleData base classes to implement a data provider for the ScheduleControl, please see the **SimpleScheduleDataProvider** code file that ships as part of the ScheduleSample sample.

#### ScheduleAppointment Class

ScheduleAppointment is the class that defines the objects that represent appointments in the Schedule Control. This class implements **IScheduleAppointment** to provide an object to hold the concrete data associated with appointments. You can either derive this class or implement **IScheduleAppointment** yourself to extend or modify the information managed by the ScheduleAppointment class. Here are the properties exposed in ScheduleAppointment.

- **UniqueID**: gets or sets a unique integer associated with this item.

## API Reference

### Properties
- **UniqueID**
  - Type: integer
  - Description: A unique identifier associated with the appointment item.
  - Default: Not specified.

## Code Examples

### C#
```csharp
public class CustomScheduleAppointment : ScheduleAppointment
{
    public override object UniqueID
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
```

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

You also have the option of deriving the ScheduleData base classes to provide custom data to the ScheduleControl. But, implementing the required interfaces directly will give you the most flexibility.

There are five interfaces that you can use to provide data for a ScheduleControl. There are two 'object' interfaces, IScheduleAppointment and ILookUpObject. These interfaces are primarily wrappers for a collection of properties.

- **IScheduleAppointment** wraps individual appointment data.
- **ILookUpObject** wraps the items you can see in drop-lists.

There are two 'list' interfaces, IScheduleAppointmentList and ILookUpObjectList. As their names suggest, these two interfaces are essentially lists of **IScheduleAppointments** and **ILookUpItems** respectively.

The last interface, **IScheduleDataProvider**, is a wrapper that holds multiple ILookUpObjectLists and one IScheduleAppointmentList. It is through this interface that the ScheduleControl interacts with the source of data, and in fact, ScheduleControl.DataSource is an IScheduleDataProvider object.

The IScheduleDataProvider object exposes methods of interacting with the data like retrieving lookup lists and providing appointments for specified time periods. The Essential Schedule source code file **ScheduleAppointment.cs** provides a base class implementation of these interfaces, exposing a partially abstract set of classes (the ScheduleData classes) that you can use to indirectly implement these interfaces.

The **SimpleScheduleDataProvider** classes that were used in the Tutorial are derived from these base classes.

The following sections discuss these required data interfaces in more detail.

## 3.4.2.1 The Appointments Data

Three of the five data interfaces work directly with the Appointment data. Here are the three interfaces.

- **IScheduleAppointment Interface**
  
  IScheduleAppointment defines the objects that represent appointments in the ScheduleControl.

## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

```csharp
/// Returns an instance of a new schedule item.
IScheduleAppointment NewScheduleAppointment();

/// Adds a schedule item to this list.
void AddItem(IScheduleAppointment item);

/// Removes a schedule item from this list.
void RemoveItem(IScheduleAppointment item);

/// Initializes the contents of the ILookUpObjectList lists.
void InitLists();

/// Returns a list holding the possible values for the <see cref="IScheduleAppointment.LocationValue"/> property.
ILookUpObjectList GetLocations();

/// Returns a list holding the possible values for the <see cref="IScheduleAppointment.MarkerValue"/> property.
ILookUpObjectList GetMarkers();

/// Returns a list holding the possible values for the <see cref="IScheduleAppointment.LabelValue"/> property.
ILookUpObjectList GetLabels();

/// Returns a list holding the possible values for the <see cref="IScheduleAppointment.ReminderValue"/> property.
/// </summary>
ILookUpObjectList GetReminders();

/// Returns a list holding the possible values for the <see cref="IScheduleAppointment.Owner"/> property.
/// </summary>
ILookUpObjectList GetOwners();
```

## 3.4.2.2 The DropLists

Two of the five data interfaces work directly with the `DropList` data. Here are the two interfaces.

### ILookUpObject Interface

`ILookUpObject` is part of the data support to provide the `DropList` data. This interface defines the object that may appear in a droplist.

## API Reference

- **Name**: ILookUpObject
- **Description**: Provides the object that may appear in a droplist.

### ILookUpObject Members

- **Methods**:
  - `ILookUpObjectList GetLocations()`
  - `ILookUpObjectList GetMarkers()`
  - `ILookUpObjectList GetLabels()`
  - `ILookUpObjectList GetReminders()`
  - `ILookUpObjectList GetOwners()`

### Sample Code

```csharp
// Example usage of ILookUpObject

ILookUpObjectList locations = GetLocations();
// Further processing of locations list
```

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Draggable Scheduling

The following code snippet demonstrates how to track the `ItemDrag` action in a scheduling control and determine the drop area during the drag action.

### C#

```csharp
{
    if (e.Action == ItemAction.ItemDrag)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dropped Area :" + e.ItemDragHitContext);
    }
}
```

### VB.NET

```vb
[VB]

Private Sub scheduleControl1_ItemChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ScheduleAppointmentCancelEventArgs)
    If e.Action = ItemAction.ItemDrag Then
        Console.WriteLine("Dropped Area :" + e.ItemDragHitContext.ToString())
    End If
End Sub
```

### Cancelling the Dropped Item

You can cancel the dropped item using the `ItemDragHitContext` property as shown below.

#### C#

```csharp
[VB]
void scheduleControl1_ItemChanging(object sender,
    ScheduleAppointmentCancelEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.ItemDragHitContext == ItemDragHitContext.Calendar)
        e.Cancel = true;
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
[VB]
Private Sub scheduleControl1_ItemChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ScheduleAppointmentCancelEventArgs)
    If e.ItemDragHitContext = ItemDragHitContext.Calendar Then
        e.Cancel = True
    End If
End Sub
```

## 5.4 How to obtain the date that is clicked in the ScheduleControl

The Clicked DateTime value of a Schedule Control can be obtained by handling the `ScheduleAppointmentClick` event as shown in the following code snippet.

### Code Example in C#

```csharp
// Subscribe to item click event.
this.scheduleControl1.ScheduleAppointmentClick += new ScheduleAppointmentClickEventHandler(scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick);

// Sample event handler to catch clicks on the schedule control.
private void scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick(object sender, ScheduleAppointmentClickEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick: {0} {1}", e.ClickType, e.ClickDateTime);
}
```

### Code Example in VB.NET

```vb.net
' Subscribe to item click event
AddHandler scheduleControl1.ScheduleAppointmentClick, AddressOf scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick

' Sample event handler to catch clicks on the schedule control.
Private Sub scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ScheduleAppointmentClickEventArgs)
    Console.WriteLine("scheduleControl1_ScheduleAppointmentClick: {0} {1}", e.ClickType, e.ClickDateTime)
End Sub
```

## API Reference

### Methods
- `PerformSwitchToScheduleViewTypeClick(ScheduleViewType.Month)`: Changes the display of the Schedule Control to the specified view type.
- `ScheduleAppointmentClick`: Event that is triggered when a specific date or time is clicked in the Schedule Control.

### Properties
- `ClickType`: Indicates the type of click that occurred.
- `ClickDateTime`: Represents the DateTime value of the clicked date or time.

## Code Examples

The provided examples demonstrate how to:
1. Switch the Schedule Control to different view types using the `PerformSwitchToScheduleViewTypeClick` method.
2. Handle the `ScheduleAppointmentClick` event to capture the clicked DateTime and ClickType information.

## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

### Overview

The NavigationCalendar object is docked at the top of this panel. There is also a Splitter docked under the Navigation Calendar that allows you to display more or fewer calendars in the NavigationCalendar. The default setting displays two such calendars.

- **Navigation Calendar**: A GridControl-derived object that displays multiple calendars, allowing you to select the dates displayed in the Schedule control. This calendar is docked at the top of the NavigationPanel. The number of calendars displayed is determined by its client height. Enlarging the height of the Navigation Calendar will display more calendars. There is a Splitter docked under the Navigation Calendar to facilitate such sizing.

- **Schedule Grid**: A Grid control-derived object that displays the actual schedule content, i.e., the appointments for the various dates. The actual look of this Grid control is determined by the `ScheduleViewType`, which is set by using the `ScheduleControl.ScheduleType` property. You can have both timed and untimed (all-day) appointments using this Schedule control. The `ScheduleControl` is easily localized and can display customizable alerts.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The Essential Schedule control primarily consists of a `UserControl` derived class named `ScheduleControl`.
- Discusses the main properties of the `ScheduleControl`, which relies on data from any object implementing `IScheduleDataProvider`.
- Focuses on the concrete implementation of the `IScheduleDataProvider`, based on an `ArrayList`-derived object that serializes to a disk file.

## Content

### ScheduleControl Properties

**ScheduleControl Implementation**
The above screen shot shows a `ScheduleControl` displaying a Month view. The four marked areas are actually `Control`-derived objects (two Panels and two `GridControls`). These controls have been added to the `ScheduleControl.Controls` collection. Any of the four controls, except the `ScheduleGrid`, can be hidden through the property settings. Here is a short description of each of the 4 labeled areas:

#### CaptionPanel
- **Type**: Panel
- **Purpose**: Displays a caption at the top of the `ScheduleControl`.
- **Additional Controls**: Two button objects on this panel for navigating the Schedule forward and backward.
- **Hide Option**: Can be hidden using the `ScheduleControl.Appearance.ShowCaption` property.
- **Docking**: Docked at the top of the `ScheduleControl` client area.

#### NavigationPanel
- **Type**: Panel
- **Purpose**: Allows you to place additional controls and make them appear adjacent to the `ScheduleControl`.
- **Docking Options**: Can be optionally docked to the left or right side of the `ScheduleControl`.
- **Hide Option**: Can also be hidden.
- **Content**:
  - **NavigationCalendar**: A `GridControl`-derived object displaying multiple calendars.
  - **Splitter**: Allows displaying more or fewer calendars in the `NavigationCalendar`. The default setting displays three.
  - **Custom Controls**: You can easily add your own controls under the `NavigationCalendar` using code similar to the snippets provided.

#### Example of Adding a Custom Control to the NavigationPanel

```csharp
// Create a new Panel
Panel p = new Panel();
// Customize the Panel's properties
p.BackColor = Color.Blue;
p.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
p.BackgroundImage = Image.FromFile(@"...\sync.png");
p.BackgroundImageLayout = ImageLayout.Tile;

// Add the Panel to the NavigationPanel
this.ScheduleControl.AddControlToNavigationPanel(p);
```

#### NavigationCalendar
- **Type**: GridControl-derived object
- **Purpose**: Displays multiple calendars, allowing you to select the dates displayed in the `ScheduleControl`.
- **Docking**: Docked at the top of the `NavigationPanel`.
- **Number of Calendars**: Determined by its client height. Enlarging the height of the `NavigationCalendar` will display more calendars.
- **Control Adjustment**: Facilitated by the Splitter docked under the `NavigationCalendar`.

### Conclusion
The `ScheduleControl` provides a flexible and customizable interface for managing and displaying scheduling data in a Windows Forms application. By leveraging the `IScheduleDataProvider` and the various properties and controls available within the `ScheduleControl`, developers can create highly personalized and functional scheduling solutions.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Content

### WinForms Integration Example: Schedule Control

The following example demonstrates the integration of the Syncfusion Schedule Control in a Windows Forms application. The code is tailored to load and manage schedule data, persisting it in a binary file named `default.schedule`. The control is configured to display the schedule in a monthly view.

```csharp
[C#]
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Data;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Text;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Schedule;
using GridScheduleSample;
using System.IO;

namespace ScheduleSample
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            SimpleScheduleDataProvider data;
            if (File.Exists("default.schedule"))
            {
                data = SimpleScheduleDataProvider.LoadBinary("default.schedule");
                data.FileName = "default.schedule";
            }
            else
            {
                data = new SimpleScheduleDataProvider();
                data.MasterList = new SimpleScheduleItemList();
                data.FileName = "default.schedule";
            }
            this.scheduleControl1.ScheduleType = ScheduleViewType.Month;
            this.scheduleControl1.DataSource = data;
        }
    }
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Namespaces and Usings**:
   - The necessary namespaces are imported, including `System`, `System.IO`, `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Schedule`, and others.

2. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Form1` class extends `Form` and initializes the Schedule Control.

3. **Schedule Data Handling**:
   - The `SimpleScheduleDataProvider` is used to manage the schedule data.
   - If the file `default.schedule` exists, it is loaded using `LoadBinary`.
   - Otherwise, a new instance of `SimpleScheduleDataProvider` is created, initialized with an empty list, and set to save the data to `default.schedule`.

4. **Schedule Control Configuration**:
   - The `ScheduleType` property is set to `Month` to display the schedule in a monthly view.
   - The `DataSource` of the Schedule Control is set to the `data` object.

5. **Persisting Changes**:
   - The application persists changes made to the schedule by saving them to the binary file `default.schedule`.

### Final Compilation and Testing

15. As our last step, compile and run the application again. The Month view should reappear, but this time the appointment you added earlier should appear.

## Overview

- This section describes the properties related to an item in the Schedule Control.
- It explains details about the Owner, Start and End times, Subject, Content, and other properties of an appointment item.
- It also outlines the `ScheduleAppointmentList` class, which manages a collection of `IScheduleAppointments` as a wrapper for an `ArrayList`.

## Content

### Properties of an Item in the Schedule Control

- **Owner**: Gets or sets an integer that can be used to identify the owner (if any) of this item.
- **StartTime**: Gets or sets the start time for this item.
- **EndTime**: Gets or sets the end time for this item.
- **Subject**: Gets or sets a text string identifying the topic of this item.
- **Content**: Gets or sets a text string holding the details or comments for this appointment item.
- **AllDay**: Gets or sets whether this appointment is an all-day appointment.
- **LabelValue**: Gets or sets an integer categorizer value for this item.
- **MarkerValue**: Gets or sets an integer categorizer value for this item.
- **Reminder**: Gets or sets whether you want a reminder event raised when the `StartTime` of this item gets close.
- **ReminderValue**: Gets or sets the type of reminder event raised when the `StartTime` of this item gets close.
- **LocationValue**: Gets or sets a string associated with this item.
- **Version**: Gets in integer format the version number (used to support data format versioning).
- **Tag**: Gets or sets an arbitrary object associated with this item.
- **Dirty**: Gets or sets whether this item has been modified.
- **IgnoreChanges**: Gets or sets whether changes to this item affect the `Dirty` property.

### ScheduleAppointmentList Class

#### Overview

The `ScheduleAppointmentList` is a collection of `IScheduleAppointments` that serves as the data for the Schedule Control. This class acts as a wrapper class for an `ArrayList` and implements the `IComparer` interface to order this list by the item's `StartTime`. If two items start at the same time, the `EndTime` is used to determine the order. Longer appointments rank higher.

#### Details of the ScheduleAppointmentList

- The `ScheduleAppointmentList` class uses an `ArrayList` internally to manage the collection of appointments.
- It implements the `IComparer` interface to sort the appointments based on their start times.
- For appointments starting at the same time, the `EndTime` is used to compare and order them.
- Longer appointments (those with a greater time span) are given priority in the order.
- Below are the properties and methods exposed in `ScheduleAppointmentList`.

### IScheduleAppointment Interface Definition

The `IScheduleAppointment` interface defines a contract for scheduling items with various properties and behaviors. Here is the complete interface definition:

```csharp
public interface IScheduleAppointment : IComparable, ICloneable
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A unique identifier for this schedule item.
    /// </summary>
    int UniqueID { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Identifies the owner of this schedule item.
    /// </summary>
    int Owner { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The start time of this item.
    /// </summary>
    DateTime StartTime { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The end time for this item.
    /// </summary>
    DateTime EndTime { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The subject or topic title for this schedule item.
    /// </summary>
    string Subject { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The text displayed as the main content of this schedule item.
    /// </summary>
    string Content { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Whether or not this item is to appear as an all day item.
    /// </summary>
    bool AllDay { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// A categorizer value for this item.
    /// </summary>
    int LabelValue { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// A categorizer value for this item.
    /// </summary>
    int MarkerValue { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Whether or not some reminder action should be taken as this item becomes current.
    /// </summary>
    bool Reminder { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates when the reminder action should be taken.
    /// </summary>
    int ReminderValue { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Some item dependent string-like the location of a meeting.
    /// </summary>
    string LocationValue { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Whether or not this item has been modified.
    /// </summary>
    bool Dirty { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Whether or not changes to this item should be ignored.
    /// </summary>
    bool IgnoreChanges { get; set; }
}
```

### Key Properties and Behavior Overview
- **UniqueID**: A unique identifier for each schedule item.
- **Owner**: Identifies the owner or user associated with the schedule item.
- **StartTime` and `EndTime**: Define the time range for the schedule item.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Defines items that can be included in an `ILookUpObjectList`.
- Choice lists within the `ScheduleControl` are used to provide possible schedule item information like location or a reminder.
- `ILookUpObject` allows such list items to have a `ValueMember` and `DisplayMember` associated with the choices, as well as a color for display in drop-down lists.
- Value members are typically serialized to data stores for persistence.

## Content

### ILookUpObject Interface

```csharp
[C#]

/// <summary>
/// Defines items that can be included in a ILookUpObjectList.
/// Choice lists within the ScheduleControl are used to provide possible
/// schedule item information like location or a reminder.
/// ILookUpObject allows such list items to have a ValueMember / DisplayMember
/// associated with
/// the choices as well as a color that will be used in drop-down
/// lists. Value members are normally the values serialized to data
/// stores.
/// </summary>
public interface ILookUpObject
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The value member associated with this item.
    /// </summary>
    int ValueMember { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The display member associated with this item.
    /// </summary>
    string DisplayMember { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// A color associated with this item.
    /// </summary>
    Color ColorMember { get; set; }
}
```

### ILookUpObjectList Interface

```csharp
[C#]

/// <summary>
/// Collection of <see cref="ILookUpObject"/> items.
/// </summary>
public interface ILookUpObjectList
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Indexer that returns a ILookUpObject object.
    /// </summary>
    ILookUpObject this[int i] { get; set; }
}
```

## Summary
- The `ILookUpObject` interface provides structure for items that can be part of a droplist in a `ScheduleControl`, enabling the association of value and display members along with a color.
- The `ILookUpObjectList` interface serves as a wrapper for a collection of `ILookUpObject` items, enabling indexed access to these droplist items.

## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

### How to prevent the switching of schedule view type

The schedule type can be changed at any time by using the `ScheduleViewType` property. Switching of view style can be prevented by making the view type as constant in the Schedule control by disabling the `SwitchViewStyle` property. By default, this property value is true.

#### Properties

| Property         | Description                                                                 | Data Type |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `SwitchViewStyle` | Gets/sets whether the view style should be changed in the Schedule control. The default value is `true`. | `bool`    |

The following codes are used to disable the `SwitchViewStyle` property.

#### C#
```csharp
this.ScheduleControl1.ScheduleType = ScheduleViewType.Month;
this.ScheduleControl1.SwitchViewStyle = false;
```

#### VB
```vb
Me.ScheduleControl1.ScheduleType = ScheduleViewType.Month
Me.ScheduleControl1.SwitchViewStyle = False
```

### How to show the start and end time with scheduled appointments

To show or hide the time of an appointment in the schedule window, the `ShowTime` property can be set to `true` or `false`. The time shown in the appointment can also be formatted by setting the time format through the `WeekMonthItemFormat` property.

#### Properties

**Table 1: Properties Table**

| Property   | Description                                  | Type       | Data Type | Reference links |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| `ShowTime` | Indicates whether the time column should appear or not | ShowTime  | Boolean     |                |

## ScheduleGrid

- **ScheduleGrid**: This is a GridControl-derived object that displays the actual schedule content, i.e., the appointments for the various dates. The actual look of this GridControl is determined by the ScheduleViewType, which is set by using the ScheduleControl.ScheduleType property.

### Adding Controls Under NavigationCalendar

Here is a Day view that shows a panel added under the NavigationCalendar by using the `ScheduleControl1.AddControlToNavigationPanel` code mentioned above.

- You can dock any control under the NavigationCalendar by using this method.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to integrate the `ScheduleControl` into a WinForms application.
- Explains the steps to configure and use the `ScheduleControl` on the design surface.
- Details the process of adding event handling for the `ScheduleControl`.

## Content

### ScheduleControl on the Design Surface
The following screenshot illustrates the `ScheduleControl` as it appears on the design surface in Visual Studio.

![The ScheduleControl on the Design Surface](insert_image_url)

**Figure 17: The ScheduleControl on the Design Surface**

### Adding a Form1_Load Handler

To implement functionality for the `ScheduleControl`, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Form1.cs` file in the code editor.
2. Locate the area of the form that is not covered by the `ScheduleControl`.
3. Double-click on this uncovered part of the form to add a `Form1_Load` event handler.

This action will automatically generate a code window displaying the `Form1_Load` method. The code should resemble the following snippet:

```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Your code here
}
```

### Explanation
- **Form1_Load**: This is a standard event triggered when the form is first loaded.
- **Code Window**: To start adding functionality for the `ScheduleControl`, such as setting default appearances or handling user interactions, you can add code within this method.

## API Reference

### Properties
- **Appearance**: Controls the visual style of the `ScheduleControl`.
  - **Default**: Provides default appearance settings for the control.
  - **Custom**: Allows customization of the appearance properties for specific needs.

## Code Examples

### C# Example
```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    scheduleControl1.Appearance = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.ScheduleControl.Appearances.Custom;
    // Further customization can be added here
}
```

### VB.NET Example
```vb.net
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    scheduleControl1.Appearance = Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.ScheduleControl.Appearances.Custom
    ' Further customization can be added here
End Sub
```

3.4 **Data used by ScheduleControl**

There are generally two types of data required by ScheduleControl. Most of the data is what we described as **Appointments data**. This data includes the time, subject, body, and so on, of each of the actual appointments.

The second type of data we refer to as the **DropLists data**. This data consists of the several option lists that go into describing the actual appointment data. For example, each appointment may have a marker associated with it that indicates something of the nature of the appointment like whether it is business, personal, a must-attend, etc. This second type of data is more like schema data, as it suggests the content options of the actual Appointments data.

```

### ScheduleDataProvider Class

#### ScheduleDataProvider Overview
- **ScheduleDataProvider** serves two primary functions:
  1. Implementing `IScheduleDataProvider` in a virtual manner to allow derived classes to provide concrete implementations through virtual overrides.
  2. Requiring derivation from this class to use its functionality.

#### Functional Roles of ScheduleDataProvider
**ScheduleDataProvider** has two functional roles:

1. **Virtual Implementation**: Derived classes implement `IScheduleDataProvider` via virtual overrides. The methods exposed in `ScheduleDataProvider` have empty implementations, necessitating derivation for use.

2. **Derived Class Requirement**: To utilize `ScheduleDataProvider`, you must derive from it.

This design ensures flexibility and extensibility in managing scheduling data for Windows Forms applications.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)
- This page focuses on the essential functionality of the Schedule control, specifically:
  - Management of `IScheduleAppointment` objects.
  - Implementation of `ScheduleDataProvider` for custom scheduling scenarios.

## Overview

- Provides methods and properties for managing and setting lists of options for various scheduling data, including `MarkerValue`, `LocationValue`, and `Owner` options.  
- Highlights the use of derived classes implementing `IListObject` for dynamic drop-down list data.  

## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the list for the MarkerValue options.
/// </summary>
protected ListObjectList MarkerList
{
    get { return markerList; }
    set { markerList = value; }
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns the list for the LocationValue options.
/// </summary>
public virtual ILookUpObjectList GetLocations()
{
    return LocationList;
}

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the list for the LocationValue options.
/// </summary>
protected ListObjectList LocationList
{
    get { return locationList; }
    set { locationList = value; }
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns the list for the Owner options.
/// </summary>
public virtual ILookUpObjectList GetOwners()
{
    return OwnerList;
}

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the list for the Owner options.
/// </summary>
protected ListObjectList OwnerList
{
    get { return ownerList; }
    set { ownerList = value; }
}
```

### 3.4.1.2 The DropLists

The second type of data required of the `ScheduleControl` is the `DropList` data. You have seen a concrete implementation of providing this `DropList` data in the **The Appointments Data** discussion. Two classes that can provide such data are listed below.

- **ListObjectClass**

  The `ListObject` is a wrapper class for list choices that can have a `ValueMember`, `DisplayMember`, and `ColorMember` associated with them. The class is an implementation of the `IListObject` that exposes the `IListObject` functionality as virtual members. This allows you to implement the `IListObject` by deriving the `ListObject` and overriding virtual properties. Here are the properties exposed by this class.

## API Reference

### ListObjectClass

- **Properties**:
  - `ValueMember`: The value to be associated with the list item.
  - `DisplayMember`: The text displayed to the user for the list item.
  - `ColorMember`: The color or style associated with the list item.

### Methods

- **GetLocations**
  ```csharp
  public virtual ILookUpObjectList GetLocations();
  ```
  - **Returns**: The list of `LocationValue` options.

- **GetOwners**
  ```csharp
  public virtual ILookUpObjectList GetOwners();
  ```
  - **Returns**: The list of `Owner` options.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of how `ListObject` can be used to populate a `DropList`:

```csharp
// Creating a ListObject list for MarkerValues
ListObjectList markerList = new ListObjectList();
markerList.Add(new ListObject("Marker1", "Red", "Value1"));
markerList.Add(new ListObject("Marker2", "Blue", "Value2"));

// Populating the GetLocations method
ILookUpObjectList locations = new LocationObjectList();
locations.Add(new LocationObject("Location1", "USA", "Code1"));
locations.Add(new LocationObject("Location2", "UK", "Code2"));
```

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## API Reference

### WinForms-specific properties

The following properties are associated with the data schema and tags for scheduling items:

- **Tag**: An arbitrary object associated with this item.
  ```csharp
  object Tag { get; set; }
  ```

- **Version**: A version associated with the data schema for this item.
  ```csharp
  int Version { get; }
  ```

### IScheduleAppointmentList Interface

#### Overview
The `IScheduleAppointmentList` interface represents a collection of `IScheduleAppointments` that serve as the data for the `ScheduleControl`.

#### Declaration
```csharp
public interface IScheduleAppointmentList
{
    /// An IScheduleAppointment referenced through an indexer.
    IScheduleAppointment this[int i] { get; set; }

    /// The number of IScheduleAppointments in this list.
    int Count { get; }

    /// Arranges the IScheduleAppointments in this list according to IScheduleAppointment.StartTime.
    void SortStartTime();

    /// Adds an IScheduleAppointment at the end of this collection.
    void Add(IScheduleAppointment item);

    /// Inserts the given IScheduleAppointment at a particular position in this collection.
    void Insert(int index, IScheduleAppointment item);

    /// Removes a given IScheduleAppointment from this collection.
    void Remove(IScheduleAppointment item);

    /// Removes an IScheduleAppointment at the given index from this collection.
    void RemoveAt(int index);

    /// Locates the index of a particular IScheduleAppointment in this collection.
    int IndexOf(IScheduleAppointment item);
}
```

### Summary
- **IScheduleAppointmentList** is an interface that provides functionality to manage a collection of scheduling appointments.
- It supports adding, inserting, removing, and locating scheduling appointments within the collection.
- The interface includes methods to sort appointments based on their start time.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## 1 Overview

This section covers information on Essential Schedule control, its key features, and prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers, and finally the documentation details complementary with the product. It comprises the following sub sections:

## 1.1 Introduction to Essential Schedule

Syncfusion Essential Schedule is a Windows Forms class library built around the functionality that is found in the Windows Forms Grid control. The control allows you to add scheduling support to your applications. The scheduling support includes creating new appointments, displaying these appointments in a variety of views, including Monthly, Daily, Weekly, Work Week and multiple days. In the daily formats, you can use the UI to drag appointments to another time slot and to extend appointments. A flexible navigation calendar lets you easily home in on the dates you would like to see in the Schedule control.

The data displayed in the Schedule control is provided through any object that implements the IScheduleDataProvider interface that is defined in the library. Included in the library is one concrete implementation based on the ArrayList that uses disk files to persist the data. With this implementation, you can easily have several schedule files that can either be treated as individual schedules or merged to be treated as a single schedule.

It is simply associated with the particular date. For the Day, WorkWeek, and Custom views, All-Day entries are displayed in a frozen row at the top of the ScheduleGrid. For Week and Month views, All-Day entries are listed with the time entries.

### All-Day Entry Display

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Data;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Text;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace ScheduleSample
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

## Content

5. Now add an existing file to this project, SimpleScheduleDataProvider.cs (or SimpleScheduleDataProvider.vb if you are using VB.NET).  
This file defines several classes that implement the interfaces that the ScheduleControl needs to manage the data associated with the appointments that will appear in the calendar.  
These interfaces are discussed in detail later in this UserGuide.  
For now, just use the implementation provided in the SimpleScheduleDataProvider.cs file.  
This file ships as part of the \SyncfusionEssentialStudio\5.x.x\Windows\Schedule.Windows\Sample.2.0\SampleSchedule sample.  
Drill down to this folder, and add this file to your project by using the Solution Explorer window as shown here.

13. Click the **Close** button on the form system menu in the upper-right corner of the form. Since the data has been modified in this `ScheduleControl`, a dialog will appear, asking whether you want to save these changes to a disk file. Click **Yes** to save the changes.

### WinForms-specific Conventions

- The `ScheduleControl` allows end-users to interact with date and time-based events visually, enabling scheduling and management functionalities.
- Appointments are added by either clicking on specific time slots or using double-click gestures. The tooltip serves as a quick reference for additional details about each event.

## API Reference

- **Namespace**: `Syncfusion.WinForms.Scheduling`
- **Class**: `ScheduleControl`
  - **Properties**
    - **Action**: Manages user interactions like adding, editing, or viewing appointments.
    - **CurrentView**: Determines how the schedule is displayed (e.g., day, week, month).

## Code Examples

### Example: Adding an Appointment to ScheduleControl

```csharp
using Syncfusion.WinForms.Scheduling;

// Assuming scheduleControl is an instance of ScheduleControl
DateTime appointmentDate = new DateTime(2006, 11, 8, 10, 0, 0);
string appointmentTitle = "Dr Appt 10:00";
string appointmentNotes = "Regular checkup - make sure to bring insurance card";

// Create an Appointment object
Appointment newAppointment = new Appointment(appointmentDate, appointmentTitle);
newAppointment.Description = appointmentNotes;

// Add the appointment to the ScheduleControl
scheduleControl.Appointments.Insert(newAppointment);

// Save the changes to a file
scheduleControl.SaveToFile("appointments.xap", ScheduleFileFormat.Xml);

## Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

The ScheduleControl does all its data access through interfaces. To support custom data objects, you would have your data objects implement these particular interfaces that are discussed in the following sections. In addition, included in the Essential Schedule library are base classes that implement these required interfaces. So, you can also create data sources for the ScheduleControl by deriving these base classes. The SimpleScheduleDataProvider classes that were used in the Tutorial are derived from these base classes.

### Base Classes

- **ScheduleDataProvider Class**: provides an empty implementation of the IScheduleDataProvider.  
  The implementation is done through virtual methods. You can then derive this class and through its overrides, set up an IScheduleDataProvider. See the SimpleScheduleDataProvider class in the ScheduleSample sample.

- **ScheduleAppointmentList Class**: provides an implementation of IScheduleAppointmentList and is essentially a wrapper class for an ArrayList that holds ScheduleAppointments.

- **ScheduleAppointment Class**: provides an implementation of IScheduleAppointment and defines the objects that represent appointments in the ScheduleControl.

- **LookUpObjectList Class**: strongly typed ArrayList that holds list option values that are used in the new appointment form.

- **LookUpObject Class**: wrapper class for list choices that can have a valueMember, displayMember, and colorMember associated with them.

The lists for the ShowTime and Label options on the Appointment forms use these objects.

### Interfaces

- **IScheduleDataProvider Interface**: provides the framework for providing schedule item data to the ScheduleControl.

- **IScheduleAppointmentList Interface**: serves as a collection of ISchedule objects.

- **IScheduleAppointment Interface**: defines individual schedule items.

- **ILookUpObjectList Interface**: serves as a collection of ILookUpObjects.

- **ILookUpObject Interface**: enables Choice lists within the ScheduleControl, that are used to provide possible schedule item information (like location or a reminder).

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

The second role is to provide the DropList data. For this second role, the ScheduleDataProvider does provide concrete implementations for the virtual methods it exposes. So, in your derived class, you would have populated droplists without doing further work, though you can choose to customize these droplists through virtual overrides. Here is a list of the stub methods exposed by ScheduleDataProvider in its first role.

```csharp
[C#]

/// <summary>
/// Returns an IScheduleAppointmentList holding the schedule items for the given date.
/// </summary>
public virtual IScheduleAppointmentList GetScheduleForDay(DateTime day)

/// <summary>
/// Returns an IScheduleAppointmentList holding the schedule items between the given dates.
/// </summary>
public virtual IScheduleAppointmentList GetSchedule(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)

/// <summary>
/// Returns an IScheduleAppointmentList holding the schedule items for a particular owner on the given date.
/// </summary>
public virtual IScheduleAppointmentList GetScheduleForDay(DateTime day, int owner)

/// <summary>
/// Returns an IScheduleAppointmentList holding the schedule items for a particular owner between the given dates.
/// </summary>
public virtual IScheduleAppointmentList GetSchedule(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate, int owner)

/// <summary>
/// Saves any modified ScheduleAppointments.
/// </summary>
public virtual void CommitChanges()

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets whether CommitChanges is called when the ScheduleControl is disposed.
/// </summary>
public SaveOnCloseBehavior SaveOnCloseBehaviorAction

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets whether data source is modified or not.
/// </summary>
public virtual bool IsDirty

/// <summary>
/// Returns a new ScheduleAppointment populated with default values.
/// </summary>
public virtual IScheduleAppointment NewScheduleAppointment()

/// <summary>
/// Adds a ScheduleAppointment to the list.
/// </summary>
public virtual void AddItem(IScheduleAppointment item)

/// <summary>
/// Removes a ScheduleAppointment from the list.
/// </summary>
public virtual void RemoveItem(IScheduleAppointment item)
```

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]

/// An integer that is stored in the data objects to represent this object.
public virtual int ValueMember

/// A string that is used when this object is displayed.
public virtual string DisplayMember

/// A color associated with this object.
public virtual Color ColorMember
```

### ListObjectList

- **ListObjectList**
  The `ListObjectList` is a strongly-typed `ArrayList` that holds a collection of `ListObjects`. The class is derived from `ArrayList` and implements both `ITypedList` and `IList`. Here are the properties and methods exposed in this class:

```csharp
[C#]

/// Returns the property descriptors for each property in ListObject.</returns>
public PropertyDescriptorCollection GetItemProperties(PropertyDescriptor[] listAccessors)

/// Returns a list name</returns>
public string GetListName(PropertyDescriptor[] listAccessors)

/// Gets or sets the i-th item in the list.
public new ILookupObject this[int i]
```

### 3.4.2 IScheduleData Interfaces

The `ScheduleControl` gets its data through its `DataSource` property, an `IScheduleDataProvider` object.

So, it is this `IScheduleDataProvider` interface (and several other associated interfaces) that gives you the ability and facility to provide data to the `ScheduleControl`.

This section discusses the actual interfaces required to provide data to the `ScheduleControl`. If you need the access your own custom datastore, then you can create objects that implement these interfaces on which the `ScheduleControl` relies to provide data from your custom datastore.

If you just need a local disk file datastore, then using the implementation provided by the classes in the `SimpleScheduleDataProvider` file that is shipped with the samples, may serve your purpose.

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

```csharp
/// Finds an IScheduleAppointment in the collection using its
/// IScheduleAppointment.UniqueID.
IScheduleAppointment Find(object uniqueID);

/// Returns an instance of a new schedule item.
IScheduleAppointment NewScheduleAppointment();

/// Returns an IEnumerator that iterates through this list.
IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
}
```

## Overview
- **IScheduleDataProvider Interface**
  - **IScheduleDataProvider** has two functional roles. One is to manage the list of Appointment data needed by the ScheduleControl. The second role is to provide the DropList data.

## IScheduleDataProvider Interface

```csharp
public interface IScheduleDataProvider
{
    /// Provides a list of schedule items for a particular day.
    IScheduleAppointmentList GetScheduleForDay(DateTime day);

    /// Provides a list of schedule items for a range of dates.
    IScheduleAppointmentList GetSchedule(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate);

    /// Provides a list of schedule items for a particular day and owner.
    IScheduleAppointmentList GetScheduleForDay(DateTime day, int owner);

    /// Provides a list of schedule items for a range of dates and a
    /// specified owner.
    IScheduleAppointmentList GetSchedule(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate, int owner);

    /// Called when the ScheduleControl needs to save modifications to
    /// the schedule items back to the data store.
    void CommitChanges();

    /// Determines whether CommitChanges is called when the top-level
    /// Form holding the ScheduleControl is closed.
    SaveOnCloseBehavior SaveOnCloseBehaviorAction

    /// Gets or sets whether the data store is modified.
    bool IsDirty
}
```

# Essential Schedule for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Demonstrates how to configure the appearance and formatting of appointments in the Schedule Control.
- Explains how to enable and set transparency levels for span appointments.

## Content

### How to set the Transparency Level of a Span Appointment

The `EnableTransparentSpan` property is used to enable transparency in Span appointments. Once you have enabled this property, you can set the transparency level (from 0 through 255) by using the `SpanTransparencyLevel` property.

#### Code Example: C#
```csharp
this.scheduleControl.Appearance.EnableTransparentSpan = true;
this.scheduleControl.Appearance.SpanTransparencyLevel = 220;
```

#### Code Example: VB
```vb
Me.scheduleControl.Appearance.EnableTransparentSpan = True
Me.scheduleControl.Appearance.SpanTransparencyLevel = 220
```

#### Code Example: VB.NET
```vb
' Show the appointment time.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ShowTime = True

// To show the appointment time based on this format.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.WeekMonthItemFormat = "[subject] [starttime][endtime]"

// Tooltip format.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ScheduleAppointmentTipFormat = "[subject] [starttime][endtime]"

// Enable the appointment tooltip.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ScheduleAppointmentTipsEnabled = True
```

#### Example Image
![](attachment:19)

## API Reference

- **Property**: `EnableTransparentSpan`
  - Type: `Boolean`
  - Description: Enables or disables transparency for span appointments.
  - Default: `False`

- **Property**: `SpanTransparencyLevel`
  - Type: `Int32`
  - Description: Sets the transparency level for span appointments (range: 0-255).
  - Default: `0`

## Code Examples

### How to Enable Transparency for Span Appointments

#### C#
```csharp
this.scheduleControl.Appearance.EnableTransparentSpan = true;
this.scheduleControl.Appearance.SpanTransparencyLevel = 220;
```

#### VB
```vb
Me.scheduleControl.Appearance.EnableTransparentSpan = True
Me.scheduleControl.Appearance.SpanTransparencyLevel = 220
```

### How to Configure Appointment Appearance

#### VB.NET
```vb
' Display the appointment time.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ShowTime = True

// Format for displaying the appointment time.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.WeekMonthItemFormat = "[subject] [starttime][endtime]"

// Tooltip format.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ScheduleAppointmentTipFormat = "[subject] [starttime][endtime]"

// Enable tooltips for appointments.
Me.ScheduleControl1.Appearance.ScheduleAppointmentTipsEnabled = True
```
