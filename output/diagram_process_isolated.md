# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## 3 Getting Started

This section helps you to understand and quickly get started using Essential Diagram in your Windows Forms applications. Control appearance and structure are defined, and the relevant classes are depicted.

### 3.1 Structure of Essential Diagram

The Essential Diagram package is comprised of the following controls:

- Diagram
- Overview
- PaletteGroupBar
- PaletteGroupView
- PropertyEditor
- DocumentExplorer

#### Diagram

The Diagram control is an interactive two-dimensional graphics control for diagramming, technical drawing, visualization, and simulation applications. It provides a surface for rendering and manipulating 2-D shapes, text, images, and Windows Form controls. The UI supports drag-and-drop, scaling, zooming, rotation, grouping, ungrouping, connection points, layouts, and many other features.

The Diagram control's architecture is composed of three objects, namely **Model**, **View**, and **Controller** and it provides a clear separation between data, visualization, and user interface. One advantage of model-view-controller architecture is that the parts are interchangeable. The model, view, and controller can be swapped in and out independently.

- **The model** contains the data (node/connector) portion of a diagram.
- **The view** is responsible for rendering the diagram.
- **The controller** handles user interaction.

The Diagram control supports both horizontal and vertical rulers.

Follow the below steps in order to open an existing diagram document:

1. Add OpenFileDialog control to the Form.
2. Set the `Filter` property of OpenFileDialog as **Essential Diagram Palettes|*.edp|Visio Stencils|*.vss; *.vsx|Visio Drawings (Shapes only)|*.vsd; *.vdx|All files|**.
3. Add the below code snippet in your button click event.

```csharp
// Checking whether "OK" button is clicked in OpenFileDialog
if (this.openFileDialog1.ShowDialog(this) == DialogResult.OK)
{
    string FileName = this.openFileDialog1.FileName;
    this.diagram1.LoadBinary(FileName);
    this.diagram1.Refresh();
}
```

The `diagram1.LoadBinary()` method loads the selected diagram file into the diagram document.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This section demonstrates how to create and customize new flow diagram symbols using the Symbol Designer in Windows Forms.

## Content

### Symbol Designer Overview

#### Figure 49: Symbol Designer With New Symbol
The image depicts the Symbol Designer interface in Windows Forms. The interface includes:
- A **Symbol Palettes** pane on the left, displaying the **Flow Diagram Symbol** category, which contains a symbol named **New Symbol1**.
- A central workspace area showing a grid where shapes can be drawn and customized.
- A rich set of tools and options at the top for drawing, formatting, and editing symbols.
- The toolbar includes options for customization such as color, size, and shape properties.

#### Instructions for Customizing Symbols
- **Draw Shapes**: Use the grid area to draw the desired shapes for your flow diagram symbol.
- **Customize Properties**: Utilize the **Property window** to change the properties of the shapes (Example: Color, Size, etc.).

### Steps to Create and Customize a Symbol

1. **Open Symbol Designer**: Launch the Symbol Designer from within the Windows Forms application.
2. **Select Symbol Palette**: Navigate to the **Symbol Palettes** pane and choose the appropriate category, such as **Flow Diagram Symbol**.
3. **Create New Symbol**: Click to create a new symbol, such as **New Symbol1**.
4. **Draw Shapes**: Use the tools available in the toolbar to draw the desired shapes in the grid area.
5. **Customize Properties**: Use the **Property window** to adjust characteristics like color, size, and other properties of the drawn shapes.

## Code Examples

### Example: Programmatically Creating a New Symbol
```csharp
// Code example demonstrating the creation of a new symbol programmatically.
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram;

// Create a new Symbol instance
Symbol newSymbol = new Symbol();

// Add shapes to the symbol
Shape shape1 = new Shape();
shape1.AddPath(new System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphPath());
newSymbol.Shapes.Add(shape1);

// Modify properties of the shape
shape1.FillColor = Color.Blue;
shape1.StrokeColor = Color.Black;
shape1.Size = new Size(50, 50);

// Add the symbol to the document
Diagram diagram = new Diagram();
diagram.Symbols.Add(newSymbol);
```

### Example: Loading a Custom Symbol from File
```csharp
// Code example demonstrating how to load a custom symbol from a file.
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram;

// Load the symbol from a file
Symbol newSymbol = Symbol.LoadFromXml("path_to_symbol_file.xml");

// Add the symbol to the document
Diagram diagram = new Diagram();
diagram.Symbols.Add(newSymbol);
```

## API Reference

### Classes and Methods
- **Symbol**: Represents a symbol in the diagram.
  - **AddPath**: Adds a graph path to the shape.
  - **FillColor**: Sets the fill color of the shape.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page explains how to create and manage symbols in the Symbol Palette using Flow Diagram Symbols in Syncfusion Winforms.

## Content

### Symbol Palette with New Symbol

#### Figure: Symbol Palette With New Symbol

The image displays a window with two sections:
1. **Left Section (Symbol Palette):**
   - Title: "Symbol Palettes"
   - Category: "Flow Diagram Symbols*"
   - New Symbol: "New Symbol1" is shown with a small yellow-green triangular shape.

2. **Right Section (New Symbol Design Area):**
   - Title: "New Symbol1"
   - Design Area: A grid layout where a new symbol is being created. The symbol consists of:
     - A green triangular shape at the top.
     - A yellow rectangular shape below the triangle.

### Instructions for Creating More Symbols
- **Repeat Steps 3 to 7:** This suggests that users should follow specific steps outlined in the documentation (not visible on this page) to create more symbols.
- **Grouping Multiple Shapes:** If a symbol is created using more than one shape, all the shapes need to be grouped into a single symbol using the "Group" option available in the symbol designer.

### Notes
- The process of creating symbols involves selecting shapes from the palette and combining them into a single design.
- Grouping ensures that all the component shapes are treated as one unit, simplifying management in flow diagrams.

## Code Examples
```csharp
// Example code for creating a grouped symbol in C#
// This is hypothetical and not directly sourced from the image

Diagram d = new Diagram();
d.Option("GroupShapes");

// Add shapes
Shape shape1 = new Shape("Triangle", "Green");
Shape shape2 = new Shape("Rectangle", "Yellow");

// Group shapes
d.GroupShapes("New Symbol1", shape1, shape2);

// Add grouped symbol to palette
SymbolPalette sp = new SymbolPalette();
sp.Add("New Symbol1");
```

## API Reference
### Methods
- `Option("GroupShapes")`: Enables grouping of multiple shapes into a single symbol.
- `GroupShapes(string symbolName, params Shape[] shapes)`: Groups multiple shapes into a single named symbol.

### Properties
- `SymbolPalette.SymbolItems`: Contains all the symbols available in the palette.

## Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

The Radial Tree Layout Manager is a specialization of the Directed Tree Layout Manager that employs a circular layout algorithm for locating the diagram nodes. The RadialTreeLayoutManager arranges nodes in a circular layout, positioning the root node at the center of the graph and the child nodes in a circular fashion around the root. Sub-trees formed by the branching of child nodes are located radially around the child nodes. This arrangement results in an ever-expanding concentric arrangement with radial proximity to the root node indicating the node level in the hierarchy.

The following parameters need should be specified for the RadialTreeLayoutManager.

| Property          | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model             | Represents the model to be attached to the Layout Manager.                |
| RotationAngle     | Defines the Graph Rotation angle. It accepts only integer values between 0-360. |
| HorizontalSpacing | Defines the horizontal offset between adjacent nodes.                      |
| VerticalSpacing   | Defines the vertical offset between adjacent nodes.                       |

Programmatically, the radial tree layout manager instance is created with the respective arguments, assigned to the Layout Manager and updated as follows:

### C#

```csharp
RadialTreeLayoutManager radialLayout = new RadialTreeLayoutManager(model1, 0, 20, 20);
this.diagram1.LayoutManager = radialLayout;
this.diagram1.LayoutManager.UpdateLayout(null);
```

### VB

```vb
Dim radialLayout As New RadialTreeLayoutManager(model1, 0, 20, 20)
Me.diagram1.LayoutManager = radialLayout
Me.diagram1.LayoutManager.UpdateLayout(Nothing)
```

Sample Diagram is as follows.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The diagram demonstrates a symmetric layout in a node-based network structure.
- The structure is centered around a red central node, with multiple layered nodes extending outward in a radial pattern.
- There are connections (arcs) between the nodes, illustrating relationships or dependencies within the network.

## Content

### Diagram with Symmetric Layout

- **Figure 83: Diagram With Symmetric Layout**
  - The diagram features a central red node, surrounded by a symmetric arrangement of nodes.
  - Pink nodes are directly connected to the central red node, forming a first layer of the structure.
  - Blue nodes are connected to the second layer (pink nodes), creating an intermediate layer.
  - Third-layer nodes (pink) are connected to the blue nodes, extending the network outward symmetrically.
  - Each layer of nodes is interconnected, demonstrating a complex, hierarchical yet balanced structure.

## Cross References
- Refer to other sections or pages in the document for more details on specific nodes, connections, or the principles of symmetric layout in network diagrams.

### Notes
- This diagram may be used as a reference for designing or visualizing network structures in Windows Forms applications.
- The symmetry and layered approach can aid in understanding complex relationships and dependencies.

In the above code snippets, the Central Port is enabled for an Ellipse node.

**Sample diagram is as follows:**

![Central Port](https://example.com/central_port_diagram.png)
*Figure 95: Central Port*

### Custom Ports

Custom ports can be defined at any position of the diagram node, thus allowing the creation of any number of connection ports at any position on the node. All the connections can be defined from the required point or port. Unlike the default port, the custom port when set, will be visible. The **DrawPorts** property must be enabled for custom ports to be created.

### Notes

**Note:** When a link is drawn to a node or another link and when the **EnableCentralPort** is set to **True**, the links cannot be connected to the custom port. Hence make sure to disable that property for the links and the nodes to connect the links to the custom ports.

#### Property Details

| Property     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DrawPorts    | Specifies whether creation of custom ports is enabled. Default value is True. |


The **Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint** class is used to create custom ports and define their properties. For details, see **ConnectionPoint Properties**.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

The point at which the connection should be established can be easily customized by setting the Position property to one of the options. This automatically associates the link to the desired position. Offset values can be specified through OffsetX and OffsetY properties, which will be inherited when the Position is set to Custom.

## Properties and Description

| Properties | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| OffsetX    | Specifies the position which takes the x value of the node. It positions the link with respect to the x value of the node. |
| OffsetY    | Specifies the Y offset value where the link should be aligned. It positions the link with respect to the Y value of the node. |
| Position   | Specifies the position where the links should be connected to the node. Default value is Center. The options included are as follows:<br><ul><li>Center</li><li>TopLeft</li><li>TopCenter</li><li>TopRight</li><li>MiddleLeft</li><li>MiddleRight</li><li>BottomLeft</li><li>BottomCenter</li><li>BottomRight</li><li>Custom</li></ul> |

## Code Snippet for Setting Position Values

### C#

```csharp
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint cp = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint();
cp.Position = Position.BottomLeft;
cp.OffsetX = 50;
cp.OffsetY = 10;
```

### Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

#### Overview
- This page explains how to handle the visibility of layers and configure rulers in a Syncfusion WinForms Diagram control.
- Layers can be used to control the visibility of all objects on a specific layer.
- Rulers can be enabled and customized programmatically using properties such as `ShowRulers` and `RulersHeight`.

## Content

### The visibility of the layer can be handled to control the visibility of all the objects on that layer.

#### C#
```csharp
Layer layer0 = new Layer();
this.diagram1.Model.Layers.Add(layer0);
layer0.Enabled = true;
layer0.Visible = true;
layer1.Visible = true;
```

#### VB
```vb
Dim layer0 As New Layer()
Me.diagram1.Model.Layers.Add(layer0)
layer0.Enabled = True
layer0.Visible = True
layer1.Visible = True
```

### 4.6.5 Rulers

Rulers can be enabled by setting the `ShowRulers` property for the diagram control. The rulers will automatically inherit the `MeasurementUnit` set for the diagram model and get converted accordingly.

The height of the ruler can be set through the `RulersHeight` property.

| Property         | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ShowRulers       | Specifies whether to display the ruler for the diagram control. |
| RulersHeight     | Specifies the height of the ruler.                   |

Programmatically the ruler properties can be set as follows.

#### C#
```csharp
this.diagram1.ShowRulers = true;
this.diagram1.RulersHeight = 25;
```

## API Reference
- **Namespace**: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram
- **Properties**:
  - `ShowRulers`: A boolean property to enable or disable the ruler display.
  - `RulersHeight`: An integer property to set the height of the ruler.

## Code Examples

### Methods
- **MagnificationFactor**:
  - Updates the zoom level of the diagram.
  - Parameters:
    - **Old**: Current magnification factor.
    - **New**: Desired magnification factor.

### Events
- **ZoomChanged**:
  - Triggered when the magnification factor changes.
  - Listener should update the view or redraw elements as needed.

## Code Examples

### C# Example
Here’s an example of how to adjust the magnification factor:

```csharp
// Assume 'diagram' is the instance of your diagram control
diagram.MagnificationFactor = new MagnificationFactor(75, 50);
diagram.OnZoomChanged();
```

### VB.NET Example
```vb
' Assume 'diagram' is the instance of your diagram control

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Set dragging, resizing, and rotation styles for the rendering helper using VB.NET.
- Customize the rendering style for specific operations like dragging, resizing, and rotating.

## Content

### Setting Rendering Styles for Diagram Operations

The following VB.NET code demonstrates how to specify the rendering styles for dragging, resizing, and rotating operations in a `Diagram` control.

```vb
' Specify dragging, resizing, and rotation styles to the rendering helper
diagram1.Controller.DraggingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.SolidOutline
diagram1.Controller.ResizingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.GhostCopy
diagram1.Controller.RotatingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.DashedOutline
```

### Explanation

- **DraggingStyle**: Configures the visual feedback when dragging nodes. Here, it is set to `RenderingHelperStyle.SolidOutline`, which draws a solid outline during dragging.
- **ResizingStyle**: Defines the visual effect during node resizing. It is set to `RenderingHelperStyle.GhostCopy`, indicating a ghost copy is displayed.
- **RotatingStyle**: Specifies the visual behavior during node rotation. The setting `RenderingHelperStyle.DashedOutline` results in a dashed outline for rotation.

### Usage Context

This code is typically used in a Windows Forms application to enhance user interaction with a diagram. By setting these styles, you can provide a more intuitive and responsive user experience.

## API Reference

- **Diagram.Controller.DraggingStyle**: Property to set the dragging style.
- **Diagram.Controller.ResizingStyle**: Property to set the resizing style.
- **Diagram.Controller.RotatingStyle**: Property to set the rotating style.
- **RenderingHelperStyle**: Enumeration for different styles such as `SolidOutline`, `GhostCopy`, and `DashedOutline`.

## Code Examples

### VB.NET Example

```vb
' Setting dragging, resizing, and rotation styles
diagram1.Controller.DraggingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.SolidOutline
diagram1.Controller.ResizingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.GhostCopy
diagram1.Controller.RotatingStyle = RenderingHelperStyle.DashedOutline
```

The below given code snippet illustrates how you can add a custom property to Diagram and display it in the Property Editor.

```csharp
//Derived Diagram
public class MyDiagram : Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Controls.Diagram
{
    public override Model CreateModel()
    {
        return new QuickStart.MainForm.MyModel();
    }
}

//Derived Model where the new property is added
public class MyModel : Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Model
{
    public override void SetDefaultPropertyValues()
    {
        base.SetDefaultPropertyValues();
        this.SetPropertyValue("MyCustomProperty", 0);
    }
    
    [Browsable(true),
    Category("MyProperties"),
    Description("Description for MyCustomProperty")]
    public int MyCustomProperty
    {
        get
        {
            object value = this.GetPropertyValue("MyCustomProperty");
            if (value != null)
            {
                return (int)value;
            }
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **MyDiagram**: Derived from `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Controls.Diagram`, overrides the `CreateModel` method to use a custom model.
- **MyModel**: Derived from `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Model`, sets default property values and defines a custom property `MyCustomProperty`.
- **Custom Property**: The `MyCustomProperty` is marked with `Browsable(true)` to ensure it is visible in the property editor. It is categorized under "MyProperties" and has a description "Description for MyCustomProperty".
- **Accessors**: The `get` accessor retrieves the value of `MyCustomProperty` from the model, handling cases where the value might be `null`.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page explains how to change the selection mode of the `SelectTool` in Syncfusion Diagrams for Windows Forms.
- It covers the properties and methods to modify the selection behavior during runtime.
- Includes examples demonstrating the implementation in C#.

## Content

### 5.4 How to Change the Selection Mode of the SelectTool

The Diagram `SelectTool` provides an enum property called `SelectMode` to change the selection mode. The following are the supported selection modes:

- **Containing** - Specific objects that are fully enclosed by the tracking rectangle will be selected by the tool.

- **Intersecting** - Specific objects that are intersecting the tracking rectangle will be selected by the tool.

**Figure 154: LineColor = "Red"**  

*Figure depicting the use of different selection modes with shapes connected by lines.*

**Containing** is the default selection mode.

The following code snippet illustrates how to change the selection mode at runtime:

```csharp
[C#]

((DiagramViewerEventSink)diagram1.EventSink).ToolActivated += new ToolEventHandler(Diagram_ToolActivated);

private void Diagram_ToolActivated(ToolEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    if (evtArgs.Tool is SelectTool)
    {
        // change the SelectionMode as "Intersecting" which specifies that objects intersecting the tracking rectangle will be selected by the tool.
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### Properties
- **SelectMode**  
  - Type: Enum (Selecting.Objects.Containing, Selecting.Objects.Intersecting)
  - Description: Determines the behavior of the selection tool when choosing objects in the diagram.
  - Default: Containing

### Events
- **ToolActivated**
  - Triggered when a tool is activated in the Diagram.
  - Parameters: `ToolEventArgs` containing the activated tool for handling specific actions.

## Code Examples

### Example: Changing Selection Mode at Runtime

The following example demonstrates how to modify the `SelectMode` property of the `SelectTool` at runtime in response to a tool activation event:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram;
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Controls;
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace DiagramDemo
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Initialize Diagram
            diagram1 = new Diagram();

            // Attach Event Handler
            ((DiagramViewerEventSink)diagram1.EventSink).ToolActivated += new ToolEventHandler(Diagram_ToolActivated);
        }

        private void Diagram_ToolActivated(ToolEventArgs evtArgs)
        {
            if (evtArgs.Tool is SelectTool)
            {
                // Set Selection Mode to Intersecting
                ((SelectTool)evtArgs.Tool).SelectMode = Selecting.Objects.Intersecting;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

```csharp
EndPointDecoratorModel decoratorMdl =
    Global.EndPointDecoratorPalette["Filled Arrow"];

if (decoratorMdl != null)
{
    link.EndPoints.LastEndPointDecorator = decoratorMdl.CreateInstance();
}
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
' Create a directional link.
Dim link As New LinkLabel.Link(pts)
Dim decoratorMdl As EndPointDecoratorModel =
    Global.EndPointDecoratorPalette("Filled Arrow")
If Not (decoratorMdl Is Nothing) Then
    link.EndPoints.LastEndPointDecorator = decoratorMdl.CreateInstance()
End If
```

## 5.12 How To Detect Whether a New Link Has Been Added / Removed From a Diagram

You can use the `Diagram.Model.ConnectionsChangeComplete` event to detect whether a new link has been added / removed from a diagram.

The following code snippet illustrates how to detect a new link that has been added to the diagram, and the symbols connected by the new link. It also illustrates how to remove a link that connects symbols of the same type.

### Detecting a New Link Added to the Diagram

```csharp
// Use the Diagram.ConnectionsChangeComplete event to be notified of the creation of a new Link.
// The Link.FromNode and Link.ToNode properties provide access to the symbols that the link connects.
private void diagram1_ConnectionsChangeComplete(object sender,
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionCollectionEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    if ((evtArgs.ChangeType == Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.CollectionExChangeType.Insert) &&
        (evtArgs.Connection != null))
    {
        Connection newconn = evtArgs.Connection;
    }
}
```
```

```vb
ElseIf evtArgs.ChangeType = CollectionExChangeType.Remove Then
    Me.label2.ForeColor = Color.Red

    ' Gets the Name of the removed element
    Me.label2.Text = "Last Node Removed: " + n.Name.ToString()
End If
End Sub
```

## 5.14 How To Display ToolTips For the Symbols

ToolTips can be displayed using the Model's `MouseEnter` and `MouseLeave` events. Here is a sample where tooltips are displayed only for nodes of the type 'MySymbol'.

### C#
```csharp
private void Model_MouseEnter(object sender, NodeMouseEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    if (evtArgs.Node.GetType() == typeof(MySymbol))
    {
        this.toolTip1.SetToolTip(this.diagram1, evtArgs.Node.Name.ToString());
        this.toolTip1.Active = true;
    }
}

private void Model_MouseLeave(object sender, NodeMouseEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    this.toolTip1.Active = false;
}
```

### VB.NET
```vb
Private Sub Model_MouseEnter(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal evtArgs As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.NodeMouseEventArgs)
    If evtArgs.Node.Name.StartsWith("MySymbol") Then
        Me.toolTip1.SetToolTip(Me.Diagram1, evtArgs.Node.Name.ToString())
        Me.toolTip1.Active = True
    End If
End Sub

## Diagram Image for Windows Forms

### Getting a Thumbnail Image of a Diagram

The following snippets demonstrate how to generate a thumbnail image of a diagram and display it in a PictureBox using both C# and VB.NET.

#### C#

```csharp
Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort myCallback = new Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort(ThumbnailCallback);
this.pictureBox1.Image = (Bitmap) diagramimage.GetThumbnailImage(150, 75, myCallback, IntPtr.Zero);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
Public Function ThumbnailCallback() As Boolean
    Return False
End Function

' Generate Thumbnail and set it to be image of the PictureBox
Dim myCallback As Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort = New Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort(AddressOf ThumbnailCallback)
Me.pictureBox1.Image = CType(diagramimage.GetThumbnailImage(150, 75, myCallback, IntPtr.Zero), Bitmap)
```

## 5.18 How to Get a Connector Vertex Point?

Connector has a method called `GetPoint` to get its vertex point.

This method has two parameters: `int` and `bool`

- `int` specifies the vertex point in the local coordinates
- `bool` specifies the path of the connector

Set the `bool` parameter to `True` to get the connector vertex point based on its graphical path and `False` to get the connector point based on its relative path.

The following code snippet illustrates this:

#### C#

```csharp
// LineConnector
ConnectorBase Connector = new LineConnector(new Drawing.PointF(0F, 0F), new Drawing.PointF(10F, 10F));

// set points
Connector.SetPoints(new PointF[2] { Connector.GetPoint(0), Connector.GetPoint(Connector.GetPoints().GetLength(0) - 1, false) });
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
' LineConnector
Dim Connector As ConnectorBase = New LineConnector(New Drawing.PointF(0F, 0F), New Drawing.PointF(10F, 10F))

' set points
Connector.SetPoints(New PointF(2) { Connector.GetPoint(0), Connector.GetPoint(Connector.GetPoints().GetLength(0) - 1, False) })
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates adding symbols programmatically from a palette to a diagram.
- Explains how to link two symbols using the LinkCmd class.

## Content

### 5.25 How To Programmatically Add a Symbol From the Palette

The following code sample demonstrates how you can programmatically add a symbol from the symbol palette to a diagram.

#### C#

```csharp
if (paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes.Count > 0)
{
    Node nc = (Node)paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes[0].Clone();
    diagram1.Model.AppendChild(nc);
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vbnet
If paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes.Count > 0 Then
    Dim nc As Node = DirectCast(paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes(0).Clone(), Node)
    diagram1.Model.AppendChild(nc)
End If
```

### 5.26 How To Programmatically Link Two Symbols

The Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.LinkCmd command class can be used to programmatically link symbols.

The following code sample shows how to create a link between two symbols, `symbol1` and `symbol2`.

```csharp
// Create a LinkCmd object.
LinkCmd linkcommand = new LinkCmd();
linkcommand.Link = new Link(Link.Shapes.Line);
```

## API Reference

### Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.LinkCmd
- **Method**: AppendChild(Node)
  - Description: Adds a cloned node to the diagram model.
  - Parameters:
    - `Node`: The node to be appended.
  - Returns: None.

### Namespace
- Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram

### Important Attributes
- **paletteGroupView1**: The view containing the symbol palette.
- **diagram1**: The target diagram to which symbols are added.
- **LinkCmd**: The command class used for linking symbols.

## Code Examples

- **C#**
  ```csharp
  // Add a symbol from the palette
  if (paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes.Count > 0)
  {
      Node nc = (Node)paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes[0].Clone();
      diagram1.Model.AppendChild(nc);
  }

  // Link two symbols
  LinkCmd linkcommand = new LinkCmd();
  linkcommand.Link = new Link(Link.Shapes.Line);
  ```

- **VB.NET**
  ```vbnet
  ' Add a symbol from the palette
  If paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes.Count > 0 Then
      Dim nc As Node = DirectCast(paletteGroupView1.Palette.Nodes(0).Clone(), Node)
      diagram1.Model.AppendChild(nc)
  End If

  ' Link two symbols
  Dim linkcommand As New LinkCmd()
  linkcommand.Link = New Link(Link.Shapes.Line)
  ```

## How To Set the Custom Position For a Label

We can adjust the label position by setting the **Position** property as 'Custom'. Then, we have to set the Offset values for the X and Y coordinates to specify the label position.

### C#

```csharp
// Setting custom position for a label

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

```csharp
SymbolPalette palette = new SymbolPalette("Palette");
// Add some nodes to the palette.
palette.AppendChild(new Ellipse(0, 0, 100, 100));
palette.AppendChild(new RoundRect(new RectangleF(0, 0, 100, 50, MeasureUnits.Pixel));
palette.AppendChild(new LineConnector(PointF.Empty, new PointF(0, 100)));
// Add the palette to PaletteGroupBar.
paletteGroupBar1.AddPalette(palette);
```

### [VB.NET]

```vbnet
' Create an instance of SymbolPalette.
Dim palette As SymbolPalette = New SymbolPalette("Palette")
' Add some nodes to the palette.
palette.AppendChild(New Ellipse(0, 0, 100, 100))
palette.AppendChild(New RoundRect(New RectangleF(0, 0, 100, 50), MeasureUnits.Pixel))
palette.AppendChild(New LineConnector(PointF.Empty, New PointF(0, 100)))
' Add the palette to PaletteGroupBar.
paletteGroupBar1.AddPalette(palette)
```

## 5.37 How to Get the Undo/Redo Description?

The `HistoryManager` class has an option to get undo or redo description. You can use the `GetUndoDescriptions` or `RedoDescriptions` method to get the desired depth of descriptions available in the history of undo or redo list, respectively. The following code example illustrates this.

### [C#]

```csharp
string[] strDescriptions;
int nDescWanted = 1;
// Gets an undo description from the undo list.
int nDescReturned =
    diagram1.Model.HistoryManager.GetUndoDescriptions(nDescWanted, out strDescriptions);
```

- It features a viewport window that can be manipulated with the mouse for resizing and repositioning, allowing runtime adjustments of origin and magnification properties.

## Content

### Diagram Control

#### Description and Breakdown
The figure below provides an overview of the Diagram Control in Windows Forms.

**Figure 5: Diagram Control**

The diagram illustrates various components of the Diagram Control:

1. **Horizontal Ruler**: Located at the top of the diagram view, it helps in measuring horizontal positions.
2. **Vertical Ruler**: Positioned on the left side, it assists in measuring vertical positions.
3. **Diagram View**: Displays the graphical content of the diagram model.
4. **Diagram Model**: Represents the underlying structure of the diagram, which includes nodes and connectors.
5. **Node**: Represents individual elements or steps in the diagram.
6. **Connector**: Indicates the links or flow between nodes.
7. **Vertical Grid Line**: Aids in aligning and positioning nodes vertically.
8. **Horizontal Grid Line**: Similar to vertical grid lines, it helps in aligning and positioning horizontally.
9. **Diargam Control**: The control area that encompasses the entire diagram layout and tools.

The diagram itself depicts a flow process, starting with "Start," leading through decision points like "Answer Phone" and branching into different scenarios, such as:
- **Product Info/Order Help**: Leading to "Take name and company" and "Transfer to sales."
- **Shipping**: Leading to a decision point "What is the problem?"
- **Billing**: Electing another decision point regarding "Problems with product."

Each path concludes with an appropriate "Finish" step, ensuring alignment with the intended workflow.

### WinForms-specific Features (Selected Components)
Illustrated components of the Diagram Control within the diagram:
- **Nodes** and their interconnections are represented as various steps within the flowchart.
- **Connector** lines depict the logical flow between these nodes, denoting transitions and triggers.

#### Key Components of the Diagram Control
1. **Horizontal Ruler**: Coordinates towards the x-axis.
2. **Vertical Ruler**: Coordinates towards the y-axis.
3. **Grid Lines**: Assists in precise positioning and alignment during editing.
4. **Viewport Management**: Enables users to dynamically adjust and interact with the diagram model.

## Overview (Detailed Explanation)
The Overview control provides a macro view of the diagram model, enabling users to:
- **Pan and Zoom**: Dynamically adjust the perspective of the diagram during runtime.
- **Viewport Window**: A movable or resizable window that modifies the diagram’s origin and magnification properties to suit user interaction needs.

### Understanding the Workflow
The diagram in the figure illustrates a simple flow process involving customer service interactions:
1. **Start**: Initiates the process.
2. **Answer Phone**: Handles incoming calls.
3. **How Can We Help?**: Directs the user to specific issues or requests.
4. **Other**: Handles miscellaneous requests outside the predefined scenarios.
5. **Product Info/Order Help**: Handles requests related to product details and order facilitation.
6. **Shipping**: Determines issues related to shipping and redirects to problem resolution.
7. **Billing**: Handles issues or inquiries related to billing.

### Dynamic Interaction
The diagram can be dynamically altered by users to:
- **Magnify or Reduce**: Adjust the zoom level to focus on specific areas or get an overall view.
- **Pan**: Navigate across the model to explore or modify components beyond the visible viewport.

## API Reference (Example)
### Class: DiagramControl
#### Methods:
- `ZoomIn()`: Increases the zoom level of the diagram.
- `ZoomOut()`: Decreases the zoom level of the diagram.
- `PanLeft()`, `PanRight()`, `PanUp()`, `PanDown()`: Provides directional navigation within the diagram.
  
#### Properties:
- `OriginX`, `OriginY`: Coordinates that define the visible area's origin.
- `ZoomLevel`: Zoom factor applied to the diagram.

### Code Example
```csharp
// Setting zoom level dynamically
diagramControl.ZoomLevel = 2.0;  // Doubles the size of the diagram.

// Panning to specific coordinates
diagramControl.PanLeft();
diagramControl.PanRight();
diagramControl.PanUp();
diagramControl.PanDown();

// Adjusting viewport manually
diagramControl.OriginX = 50;  // Moves the visible origin horizontally.
diagramControl.OriginY = 50;  // Moves the visible origin vertically.
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the diagram model remains synchronized with the diagram view during interactive adjustments.
- Customizing user interactions like panning and zooming can significantly improve user experience, especially when dealing with large or complex diagrams.

Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle process =
    new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle(50, 50, 100, 70);

// Style the process node
process.FillStyle.Type = FillStyleType.LinearGradient;
process.FillStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(128, 0, 0);
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Creating a Process Node**:
   - A `Rectangle` node is created using the `Diagram.Rectangle` class.
   - The `Rectangle` is initialized with its position (50, 50) and size (100, 70).

2. **Styling the Process Node**:
   - The `FillStyle.Type` property is set to `FillStyleType.LinearGradient` to apply a gradient fill.
   - The `FillStyle.Color` property is set to `Color.FromArgb(128, 0, 0)` to define the color of the fill.

#### Note
- This example focuses on creating and styling a process node. The connection between nodes is achieved using predefined or custom connectors.

### Creating and Configuring a Decision Node

#### Code Example

```vb
New PointF (50, 100),
New PointF (0, 50)
})

' Style the decision node
decision.FillStyle.Type = FillStyleType.LinearGradient
decision.FillStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(128, 0, 0)
decision.FillStyle.ForeColor = Color.FromArgb(225, 0, 0)

' Border style
decision.LineStyle.LineColor = Color.RosyBrown
decision.LineStyle.LineWidth = 2.0F
decision.LineStyle.LineJoin = Drawing2D.LineJoin.Miter

' Add a label to the decision node
label = New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Label()
label.Text = "Decision"
label.FontStyle.Family = "Arial"
label.FontColorStyle.Color = Color.White
decision.Labels.Add(label)

' Position the decision node
decision.PinPoint = New PointF (250, 250)
' Add decision node to the model
diagram.Model.AppendChild(decision)

' Create an orthogonal connector
Dim link As New OrthogonalConnector(process.PinPoint,
    decision.PinPoint)

' Style the link
link.LineStyle.LineColor = Color.RosyBrown
link.LineStyle.LineWidth = 2.0F
```

### Explanation

1. **Decision Node Configuration**
   - **Fill Style**: The decision node is styled with a linear gradient filled in dark red shades (RGB values: 128, 0, 0, and 225, 0, 0). This creates a visually distinct appearance for the node.
   - **Border Style**: The border is set to RosyBrown color with a width of 2.0F, and the line join property is set to Miter, ensuring sharp, clean borders.

2. **Adding Labels**
   - A label is added to the decision node. The label text is "Decision," styled with Arial font and white text color, ensuring readability against the dark background fill.

3. **Positioning**
   - The decision node is positioned at the coordinates (250, 250) using the PinPoint property.

4. **Connecting Nodes**
   - An orthogonal connector is created between a `process` node and the decision node. 
   - The connector is styled with a RosyBrown color and a width of 2.0F, matching the border style of the decision node.

this.Controls.Add(documentExplorer);
```

### Example Code in VB

Here is an equivalent example in VB for creating and attaching a `DocumentExplorer` to a form:

```vb
'Imports the Diagram control's namespace
Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Controls

'Creates a DocumentExplorer instance
Dim documentExplorer As New DocumentExplorer()
documentExplorer.Dock = DockStyle.Left

'Attach a diagram model to documentExplorer
documentExplorer.AttachModel(Diagram1.Model)

'Add documentExplorer to the form
Me.Controls.Add(documentExplorer)
```

### Explanation

1. **Imports**: The code imports the required namespace for the Diagram control.
2. **Instance Creation**: A `DocumentExplorer` instance is created and its docking property is set to `DockStyle.Left` to dock the explorer on the left side of the form.
3. **Model Attachment**: A diagram model is attached to the `DocumentExplorer` to display relevant content within it.
4. **Control Addition**: The `DocumentExplorer` is added to the form's controls collection to make it visible.

## API Reference

- **Namespace**: `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Controls`
- **Class**: `DocumentExplorer`
  - Method: `AttachModel(Model model)`
    - Description: Attaches a diagram model to the `DocumentExplorer`.
  - Property: `Dock`
    - Description: Determines the docking style of the control within the form.

### Steps to Use Symbol Palette

1. **Adding Symbols to Associated Palettes**:
   - On placing a symbol into the diagram area, the Diagram Builder displays a dialog for adding the symbol palette into the Associated Palettes.
   - To add the symbol palette, click **OK**.
   - If it is not required, click **Cancel**.

2. **Placing and Customizing Symbols**:
   - Place the symbols in the diagram area as needed.
   - Change their properties according to the requirements.
   - Finally, save the file with the **.edd** extension.

## Code Examples

The following example demonstrates how to programmatically add symbols from the Symbol Palette to a Diagram in a Windows Forms application:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram;

// Create a new Diagram instance
Diagram diagram = new Diagram();

// Load the symbol palette
SymbolPalette symbolPalette = new SymbolPalette();

// Add symbols to diagram
Symbol symbol = symbolPalette.GetSymbol(@"FloorPlanShapes\Bed");
DiagramNode node = diagram.Nodes.Add(new DiagramNode(symbol));

// Customize properties
node.Size = new SizeF(100, 100);
node.Location = new PointF(50, 50);

// Save the diagram
diagram.Save("diagram.edd");
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Illustrates the use of symbolic representations in diagrams.
- Demonstrates how a simple combination of geometric shapes can create symbolic patterns.
- Highlights the structure of a house-like symbol.

## Content

### Diagram Symbol Example
The diagram below shows a simple symbolic representation consisting of a green triangle sitting atop a yellow rectangle. This structure is often used to create symbolism or icons.

![Figure 50](https://example.com/fig50)  
*Figure 50: Symbol*

This figure showcases a basic geometric combination often utilized in diagramming and graphical representations for defining elements such as a house, a structure, or a building. The green triangle at the top represents the roof, while the yellow rectangle represents the body of the building.

### Explanation
- **Green Triangle**: Symbolizes the roof or upper part of the structure.
- **Yellow Rectangle**: Represents the main body or foundation.
- This combination can be integrated into more complex diagrams where such symbols are needed to represent structures or components.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Activates the Org line connector tool.
- Customizing nodes under the topics: Line Bridging.

## Content

### Line Bridging

#### 4.4 Customizing Nodes

This section discusses how to customize Diagram nodes, under the following topics:

##### 4.4.1 Line Bridging

Line bridging provides the visual effect such that the links jump over other links that are found in its way with lower ZOrder, thereby avoiding the links from intersecting each other and providing a hassle-free view to clearly state the various connections between the nodes. This is done by enabling the LineBridgingEnabled property. Default value is `false`.

### Code Example

```vb
'Activates the Org line connector tool.
diagram1.Controller.ActivateTool("OrgLineConnectorTool")
```

#### Figure 69: Org line Connector

![](https://via.placeholder.com/200x200?text=Org+line+Connector)

---

## API Reference

### Methods
- `ActivateTool(toolName As String)`

#### Parameters
- `toolName` - The name of the tool to be activated.

#### Returns
- No return value.

#### Exceptions
- If the specified tool does not exist.

## Code Examples

### VB.NET

```vb
' Activates the Org line connector tool.
diagram1.Controller.ActivateTool("OrgLineConnectorTool")
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

```csharp
this.diagram1.Model.LineRouter.DistanceToObstacles = 20;
this.diagram1.Model.LineRouter.RoutingMode = RoutingMode.Automatic;
```

```vb
Me.diagram1.Model.LineRouter.DistanceToObstacles = 20
Me.diagram1.Model.LineRouter.RoutingMode = RoutingMode.Automatic
```

The **LineBridgingEnabled**, **LineRoutingEnabled** properties can be set for the diagram, in which case it will be automatically applied to all the links added to the model. Else it can be enabled only for the required links individually.

## Node settings

When line routing is enabled, make sure to set the **TreatAsObstacle** property of the objects to `true`, to avoid the links running over them. If not set for an object, then that node will not be considered as an obstacle and the link will pass over it.

Programmatically it can be set as follows:

```csharp
circle.TreatAsObstacle = true;
```

```vb
circle.TreatAsObstacle = True
```

In the above code snippets, the **TreatAsObstacle** property is set to the circle object.

### 4.4.3 Grouping

A group is a node that acts as a transparent container for other nodes. A group is a composite node that controls a set of child nodes. The bounding rectangle of a group is the union of the bounds of its children. The group renders itself by iterating through its children and rendering them. Child nodes cannot be selected or manipulated individually. Members of the group are added and removed through the **ICompositeNode** interface.

The following code snippet creates a group with two nodes.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses layouts for directed tree structures with rotation angles.
- Two types of tree layouts are demonstrated: top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top.
- Rotation angles of 0° and 180° are used to demonstrate the effects on the layout orientation.

## Content

### Directed Tree Layouts

#### Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle
![Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle](#)
**Figure 77: Top-to-Bottom Directed Tree Layout with 0 degree Rotation Angle**

This layout shows a directed tree structure with a top-to-bottom orientation. The root node is at the top, and the nodes are arranged in a horizontal line extending from this root. Each node in the horizontal line has one or more child nodes further below, demonstrating a hierarchical relationship.

#### Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle
![Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle](#)
**Figure 78: Bottom-to-Top Directed Tree Layout with 180 degree Rotation Angle**

This layout shows a directed tree structure with a bottom-to-top orientation. The root node is at the bottom, and the nodes are arranged in a horizontal line extending upwards from this root. Each node in the horizontal line has one or more child nodes above it, creating a reverse hierarchical structure compared to the top-to-bottom layout.

## Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

**OrgChart Alignment**

As the OrgChartLayout follows a Waterfall model, whenever there is only one child node, the layout will be widened. To overcome this, Essential diagram enables you to align the single child node parallel to the parent node, which will reduce the layout structure.

### Code Examples

- **[C#]**
  ```csharp
  OrgChartLayoutManager manager = new OrgChartLayoutManager(this.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50, LayoutType.Waterfall, 1, true);
  ```

- **[VB]**
  ```vb
  Dim manager As New OrgChartLayoutManager(Me.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50, LayoutType.Waterfall, 1, True)
  ```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Provides details on properties for controlling node editing in a diagram.
- Explains how to programmatically set these properties using C# and VB.NET.
- Discusses the use of the `EditStyle` properties to customize node editing behavior.

## Content

### EditStyle Properties

| Property             | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AllowVertexEdit      | Specifies whether or not to edit the vertex. Default value is **True**.                      |
| HidePinPoint         | Specifies whether to show or hide the PinPoint. Default value is **False**.                 |
| HideRotationhandle   | Specifies whether to show or hide the RotationHandle in order to control the rotation of the node. Default value is **False**. |

### Setting Properties Programmatically

#### C#

```csharp
rect.EditStyle.AspectRatio = true;
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Resize;
rect.EditStyle.Enabled = true;
rect.EditStyle.AllowVertexEdit = true;
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Vertex;
rect.EditStyle.HidePinPoint = true;
rect.EditStyle.HideRotationHandle = true;
```

#### VB

```vb
rect.EditStyle.AspectRatio = True
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Resize
rect.EditStyle.Enabled = True
rect.EditStyle.AllowVertexEdit = True
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Vertex
rect.EditStyle.HidePinPoint = True
rect.EditStyle.HideRotationHandle = True
```

Thus, in the above code snippets, the properties are set to the Rectangular node (`rect`) created through the code.

## API Reference (if applicable)

### EditStyle Properties

#### AspectRatio
- Type: `bool`
- Description: Controls whether the node maintains aspect ratio during resizing. Default is `True`.
- Default: `True`

#### DefaultHandleEditMode
- Type: `HandleEditMode`
- Description: Specifies the default mode for handle editing. Default is `HandleEditMode.Resize`.
- Default: `HandleEditMode.Resize`

#### Enabled
- Type: `bool`
- Description: Enables or disables node editing. Default is `True`.
- Default: `True`

#### AllowVertexEdit
- Type: `bool`
- Description: Enables or disables vertex editing. Default is `True`.
- Default: `True`

#### HidePinPoint
- Type: `bool`
- Description: Determines whether to show or hide the PinPoint. Default is `False`.
- Default: `False`

#### HideRotationHandle
- Type: `bool`
- Description: Determines whether to show or hide the RotationHandle. Default is `False`.
- Default: `False`

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

### Implemented Example in C#

Here is an example of how these properties can be set programmatically in a C# application:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram;

// Assume 'rect' is a Rectangular node
DiagramNode rect = new DiagramNode();

// Set the properties using EditStyle
rect.EditStyle.AspectRatio = true;
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Resize;
rect.EditStyle.Enabled = true;
rect.EditStyle.AllowVertexEdit = true;
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Vertex;
rect.EditStyle.HidePinPoint = true;
rect.EditStyle.HideRotationHandle = true;

// Add the node to the diagram
Diagram diagram = new Diagram();
diagram.Nodes.Add(rect);
```

### Implemented Example in VB.NET

Here is an example of how these properties can be set programmatically in a VB.NET application:

```vb
Imports Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram

' Assume 'rect' is a Rectangular node
Dim rect As New DiagramNode()

' Set the properties using EditStyle
rect.EditStyle.AspectRatio = True
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Resize
rect.EditStyle.Enabled = True
rect.EditStyle.AllowVertexEdit = True
rect.EditStyle.DefaultHandleEditMode = HandleEditMode.Vertex
rect.EditStyle.HidePinPoint = True
rect.EditStyle.HideRotationHandle = True

' Add the node to the diagram
Dim diagram As New Diagram()
diagram.Nodes.Add(rect)
```

In both examples, the properties are set to the Rectangular node (`rect`) created programmatically, demonstrating how to customize the editing behavior of the node in a diagram.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to create a rectangle node with custom ports using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle.
- Explains the use of `ConnectionPoint` to define ports on a node.
- Describes how to customize port shapes using the `VisualType` property.

## Content

### Example Code

[C#]

```csharp
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle rect = new
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 50);
rect.DrawPorts = true;
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint cp = new
Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint();
rect.Ports.Add(cp);
```

[VB]

```vb
Dim rect As New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 50)
rect.DrawPorts = True
Dim cp As New Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.ConnectionPoint()
rect.Ports.Add(cp)
```

#### Sample diagram is as follows.

![Rectangle Node with Four Custom Ports](images/rectangle_node_with_ports.jpg)

**Figure 96: Rectangle Node with Four Custom Ports**

### Port Shapes

The `VisualType` property available for the port can be used for customizing the shape of the port. There are several types of ports available for customizing the port's shape, each of which differs depending on how they are positioned within the symbol and how they are rendered. For example, a `CirclePort` can be positioned anywhere within the bounds of a symbol and renders itself as a circle containing cross hairs. Another example is a `CenterPort`, which always positions itself in the center of the symbol and has no visual representation.

#### Properties and Descriptions

| Property       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VisualType     | Used for customizing the shape of the port. Various types of ports can be used. |

### Understanding Layers in Diagrams
Layers arrange graphical objects into groups that share default properties and Z-order. Users have the freedom to add any number of layers and move objects between them. Objects in a single layer are rendered with the same Z-order, allowing relative control over visibility compared to other layers. 

#### Use Case: Separating Text and Links
Layers enable grouping nodes, such as text and links, separately from other nodes. For example, nodes created for text and links can be added to their respective layers. The following code snippet demonstrates the creation of three layers and assigning them to various nodes.

#### Use Case: Grouping Nodes in Collections
Layers can group nodes in collections, allowing users to show or hide entire groups of nodes by toggling the visibility of their parent layers. A single node can be assigned to multiple layers, but it will only be visible if all its assigned layers are visible. If any layer is hidden, the node will not be drawn.

#### Implementation
Programmatically, layers can be implemented as follows:

```csharp
// Layer 1

PointF[] pts1 = { new PointF(50, 25), new PointF(75, 75), new PointF(100, 25), new PointF(125, 75), new PointF(150, 25), new PointF(175, 75), new PointF(200, 25) };
CurveNode cn = new CurveNode(pts1);
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(cn);
Layer layer1 = new Layer();
cn.Layers.Add(layer1);

// Layer 2

PointF[] pts = { new PointF(10, 100), new PointF(50, 25), new PointF(34, 78), new PointF(100, 78) };
ClosedCurveNode ccn = new ClosedCurveNode(pts);
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(ccn);
Layer layer2 = new Layer();
ccn.Layers.Add(layer2);

// Layer 3

PointF pt = new PointF(50F, 200F);
PointF pt1 = new PointF(200F, 100F);
BezierCurve bc = new BezierCurve(pt, pt1);
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(bc);
SplineNode sp = new SplineNode(new PointF(130, 200), new PointF(200, 200), new PointF(120, 40));
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(sp);
```

### Key Insights
- **Layer Assignment:** Nodes are added to specific layers to control their visibility and organization within the diagram.
- **Multiple Layer Assignments:** A single node can be assigned to multiple layers, ensuring consistent visibility across all assigned layers.
- **Programmatic Layer Creation:** Using methods like `Layer`, `CurveNode`, `ClosedCurveNode`, and others, layers can be programmatically created and assigned to nodes.

#### Cross References
- Refer to the relevant sections on `Layer`, `CurveNode`, `ClosedCurveNode`, and `BezierCurve` for more details on implementation.

## Overview
This page discusses grouping in diagrams within Syncfusion Winforms. It covers the concept of groups as transparent containers for child nodes and explains how groups are added and manipulated using the `ICompositeNode` interface. The section includes code examples for creating a group with child nodes.

## Content

### Horizontal Ruler Property Settings
**Figure 112: Horizontal Ruler Property Settings**

The figure illustrates the use of the horizontal ruler in property settings within the diagram control. The ruler is marked with measurement units at intervals, and a yellow rectangle indicates a selected object or area with manipulation handles.

### 4.6.6 Grouping
A group is a node that acts as a transparent container for other nodes. It is a composite node that controls a set of child nodes. The bounding rectangle of a group is the union of the bounds of its children. The group renders itself by iterating through its children and rendering them. Child nodes cannot be selected or manipulated individually. Members of the group are added and removed through the `ICompositeNode` interface.

There are two ways available to add a Group in diagram control:

1. **Add the children to the group manually with the help of Group class methods.** The below code snippet creates a group with two nodes.

```csharp
[C#]
```

## API Reference (if applicable)
This section provides references to relevant APIs used in grouping within the diagram control, such as methods and interfaces like `ICompositeNode`.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
Example of creating a group with two nodes in C#:
```csharp
[C#]
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page explains how to handle tool-activated events in Essential Diagram for Windows Forms.
- It features a simple flow diagram illustrating the sequence of operations during a tool-activated event.

## Content

### Tool Activated Event

#### Diagram Overview
The diagram below demonstrates the flow of actions taken when a tool is activated within a Windows Forms application.

![Simple Flow Diagram](#)
*FIGURE 128: Tool Activated Event*

**Figure 128: Tool Activated Event**

The flow diagram consists of four main components, illustrated as follows:

1. **START**: Denotes the beginning of the event sequence.
2. **PROCESS**: Represents the process where the tool activation is handled.
3. **CHECK**: Indicates a check operation to identify the activated tool and its status.
4. **END**: Marks the completion of the event sequence.

#### Explanation of the Diagram
- **START**: Initiates the sequence of operations.
- **PROCESS**: Refers to the handling of the activated tool within the application logic.
- **CHECK**: Validates the tool details such as the tool name (`ZoomTool`) and its status (`False`), as shown in the accompanying dialog box.
- **END**: Concludes the event handling process.

### Dialog Box Details
The dialog box in the diagram provides specific information:
- **Activated Tool Name**: ZoomTool
- **Status**: False

This indicates that the tool activation event is reported, even if the tool is not currently active.

### Summary
This flow diagram helps developers understand the sequence of operations related to tool activation in Windows Forms, ensuring they can appropriately handle such events within their applications.

## Code Examples
This section may include code examples demonstrating how to implement the identified process, check, and manage the tool activated events in Syncfusion Winforms. The code examples would likely involve handling events and validating tool states.

```csharp
// Example of handling the ToolActivated event in Syncfusion Winforms
diagram1.ToolActivated += (sender, e) => {
    MessageBox.Show(
        $"Activated Tool Name: {e.Tool.Name}\nStatus: {e.Tool.IsActivated}",
        "Tool Activated",
        MessageBoxButtons.OK,
        MessageBoxIcon.Information
    );
};
```

private void OnDiagramOriginChanged(object sender, ViewOriginEventArgs e)
{
    textBox1.Text = string.Format("X={0}, Y={1} | New X={2}, New Y={3}",
        e.OriginalOrigin.X, e.OriginalOrigin.Y, e.NewOrigin.X, e.NewOrigin.Y);
}

private void DisplayNodeCount()
{
    MessageBox.Show("Node count = " + nodeStack.Count);
}

private void EnableScrolling()
{
    diagram1.HScroll = true;
    diagram1.VScroll = true;
}

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Displays diagram nodes with different styles, including `GhostCopy`, `FilledRectangle`, `SolidOutline`, and `DashedOutline`.
- Introduces the concept of dynamic properties for nodes and connectors.

## Content

### Illustrated Diagram Nodes

#### Figure 152: Diagram nodes with different styles

The figure illustrates various styles for diagram nodes:

1. **GhostCopy**: Shows ghosted nodes with a highlighted bounding box.
2. **FilledRectangle**: Demonstrates a filled rectangular shape with a highlighted bounding box.
3. **SolidOutline**: Displays a rectangular shape with a solid outline and a highlighted bounding box.
4. **DashedOutline**: Illustrates a rectangular shape with a dashed outline and a highlighted bounding box.

Each node has a green bounding box with a small circular grip at the top center, indicating manipulability and style options.

### 4.6.13 Dynamic Properties

#### Overview

This feature allows users to add additional properties or data to the nodes and connectors. Any type of data can be added as additional data or properties.

#### Implementation Details

The node's `PropertyBag` property, which is a key-value pair, is used to add, edit, and remove the additional properties or data. This information can be serialized when saving the diagram.

## 5.5 How To Combine Different Actions Into One Atomic Action To Avoid the Undo Operation On Certain Actions

This is done by calling the Model.HistoryManager.StartAtomicAction(string description) / EndAtomicAction() methods.

The actions can be recorded into the history manager such that the undo and redo operations can be performed. The recording can be controlled and the undo and redo actions can be performed using the following tools.

- **StartAtomicAction**-This tool, when called, stops recording the actions and hence will not be added to the undo history manager.
- **EndAtomicAction**-This tool cancels the StartAtomicAction process and turns on the recording of actions in the history manager.

- Programmatic connection creation is sometimes useful, such as generating diagrams from database data or using custom link tools.
- Direct connections between symbols without intermediate links can also be created.

## Content

### Connecting Symbols with Links

The following code creates a link and connects it to the center ports of two symbols.

```csharp
public Link LinkSymbols(Symbol sym1, Symbol sym2)
{
    Link link = new Link(Link.Shapes.Line);
    sym1.Connect(sym1.CenterPort, link.TailPort);
    sym2.Connect(link.HeadPort, sym2.CenterPort);
    return link;
}
```

```vb.net
Public Function LinkSymbols(ByVal sym1 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Symbol, ByVal sym2 As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Symbol) As LinkLabel.Link
    Dim link As LinkLabel.Link = New LinkLabel.Link(Link.Shapes.Line)
    sym1.Connect(sym1.CenterPort, link.TailPort)
    sym2.Connect(link.HeadPort, sym2.CenterPort)
    Return link
End Function
```

## Overview
- Explains how to draw custom handles for nodes using the CustomHandleRenderer Property.
- Covers customization and implementation specifics for achieving custom appearances in node handles.

## How To Draw Custom Handles For Nodes Using the CustomHandleRenderer Property

Syncfusion Diagram provides users with the facility to draw their own handles for nodes using the `CustomHandleRenderer` property, which is available in the `View` class. This property accepts instances of the `UserHandleRenderer` class, which acts as a base class for custom Handle Renderers. By using this class, we can derive a class to create our own Handle Renderer and assign it to the `View.CustomHandleRenderer` property. If this property is assigned as `'Null'`, it will render the default style of the Handle.

![Default Appearance](figure.png)
*Figure 155: Default Appearance*

The `UserHandleRenderer` class methods are made as public virtual; this class duplicates the `HandleRenderer` functionality but has a more convenient structure for overriding the default appearance. It provides an option to implement the new handle renderer with minimal changes by deriving it. If you are having a source code license, you can see the complete source `UserHandleRenderer` in the following location for understanding more about handle renderers: Diagram.Base\\Src\\Utility\\HandleRenderer.cs.

Here is a sample code snippet.

```csharp
[C#]
public class MyHandleRenderer : UserHandleRenderer
{
```

## API Reference (if applicable)
- **Namespace**: Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram
- **Class**: `UserHandleRenderer`
  - **Inheritance**: Derived from `HandleRenderer`
  - **Properties**:
    - `CustomHandleRenderer`: Allows customization of node handles.
  - **Deriving Classes**: You can derive your own handle renderer by inheriting from `UserHandleRenderer`.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

### C#
```csharp
public class MyHandleRenderer : UserHandleRenderer
{
    // Implement customization logic here
}
```

```csharp
//Current mouse position
Point ptMouse = new Point(e.X, e.Y);
int rulerHeight = (diagram1.ShowRulers) ? diagram1.RulersHeight : 0;
//Nearest grid point
Point ptGridNearestPoint = diagram1.View.Grid.GetNearestGridPoint(ptMouse, rulerHeight);
```

##### VB.NET
```vb
'Current mouse position
Dim ptMouse As Point = New Point(e.X, e.Y)
Dim rulerHeight As Integer
rulerHeight = If(diagram1.ShowRulers, diagram1.RulersHeight, 0)
```

### 5.27 How To Retain the Custom Position Of the Label While Resizing the Node

We can retain the label's offset value using the **SizeChanged** event. While resizing a node, the **SizeEvent** gets fired. Using this event we can retain the label's position.

```csharp
[C#]

// Adding Event Handler
((DocumentEventSink)diagram1.Model.EventSink).SizeChanged += new
SizeChangedEventHandler(Form1_SizeChanged);
outerRect.Labels.Add(new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Label());
outerRect.Labels[0].Text = "Rectangle";
outerRect.Labels[0].Position = Position.Custom;
outerRect.Labels[0].OffsetX = outerRect.Size.Width / 2;
outerRect.Labels[0].OffsetY = outerRect.Size.Height;

// Resizing
void Form1_SizeChanged(SizeChangedEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    outerRect.Labels[0].OffsetX = outerRect.Size.Width / 2;
}
```

- Demonstrates using the `HistoryManager` for getting undo and redo descriptions.
- Explains how to import Visio stencils into symbol palettes using the VisioStencilConverter class.

## Content

### History Management
```csharp
// Gets a redo description from the redo list.
nDescReturned =
    diagram1.Model.HistoryManager.GetRedoDescriptions(nDescWanted, out strDescriptions);
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

Dim strDescriptions() As String
Dim nDescWanted As Integer = 1
' Gets an undo description from the undo list.
Dim nDescReturned As Integer =
    diagram1.Model.HistoryManager.GetUndoDescriptions(nDescWanted, strDescriptions)
' Gets a redo description from the redo list.
nDescReturned =
    diagram1.Model.HistoryManager.GetRedoDescriptions(nDescWanted, strDescriptions)
```

### Importing Visio Stencils

#### 5.38 How to Import Visio Stencil?
You can import Visio stencils (.vss and .vsx) into symbol palettes. Essential Diagram uses the Visio stencil converter to convert the stencils as the symbol palette. You have to add `Syncfusion.Diagram.Utility.Windows.dll` as a reference in your application to use this converter.

The following code example illustrates how to convert Visio stencils into symbol palettes.

```csharp
[C#]
SymbolPalette paletteToReturn = null;
string strFileName = "Basic Flowchart Shapes.vss";
// Create an instance of VisioStencilConverter
VisioStencilConverter converter = new VisioStencilConverter(strFileName);
converter.ShowProgressDialog = true;
// Convert the stencil as SymbolPalette
paletteToReturn = converter.Convert();
paletteGroupBarl.AddPalette(paletteToReturn);
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
```

## API Reference

### Namespaces and Classes
- `Syncfusion.Diagram.HistoryManager`
- `Syncfusion.Diagram.Utility.Windows.VisioStencilConverter`

### Methods
- `GetUndoDescriptions(nDescWanted, strDescriptions)`
- `GetRedoDescriptions(nDescWanted, out strDescriptions)`
- `Convert()`

### Parameters
- `nDescWanted`: The index of the description you want to retrieve.
- `strDescriptions`: An array to hold the undo/redo descriptions.
- `strFileName`: The file name of the Visio stencil to be converted.

## Code Examples

### C# Example
```csharp
SymbolPalette paletteToReturn = null;
string strFileName = "Basic Flowchart Shapes.vss";
 VisioStencilConverter converter = new VisioStencilConverter(strFileName);
converter.ShowProgressDialog = true;
paletteToReturn = converter.Convert();
paletteGroupBarl.AddPalette(paletteToReturn);
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

This section covers information on Essential Diagram control, its key features, and prerequisites to use the control, its compatibility with various OS and browsers, and finally the documentation details complementary with the product. It comprises the following sub sections:

### 1.1 Introduction To Essential Diagram

Essential Diagram is an extensible and high-performance .NET diagramming framework for Windows Applications. It can be used for developing Microsoft Visio-like interactive graphics and diagramming applications. It stores graphical objects in a node graph and renders those objects onto the screen. Essential Diagram supports both vector and raster graphics on the drawing surface.

Essential Diagram lets users create interactive diagrams easily using the Diagram Builder utility included with the Diagram. It explicitly lays out diagram objects, or allows our built-in layout managers to handle the job, making complex layout diagrams a snap. Using the Symbol Designer utility, you can create domain or business specific symbols by using custom shapes and images.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Describes how to set up the page layout for a diagram document.
- Explains the use of a dialog box for configuring page borders.
- Demonstrates code snippets for implementing page setup and border customization.

## Content

### Setting Up the Diagram Page

The following code snippet can be used for setting the page setup for a diagram document.

```csharp
[C#]
if (diagram1 == null || diagram1.Model == null)
    return;
using (PageSetupDialog dlgPageSetup = new
    PageSetupDialog(diagram1.View))
{
    if (dlgPageSetup.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        diagram1.UpdateView();
    }
}
```

#### Diagram Page Setup Dialog Box

Figure 31: Diagram page Setup Dialog Box

The page setup dialog box allows users to configure various settings such as printer paper size, orientation, and print zoom. Adjustments can be made visually, and settings are applied to the diagram page.

#### Page Borders

**2. Page Borders**

The **Page Borders** dialog provides an interactive form-based interface for setting the page borders of a diagram. This dialog initializes the `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.PageBorderDialog` with the `PageBorderStyle` property corresponding to the `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.View.PageBorderStyle` member of the diagram's view. This setup enables users to configure page border settings using the dialog controls.

The following code snippet can be used for setting the page border for a diagram document.

```csharp
[C#]
if (diagram1 != null && diagram1.Model != null)
```

### API Reference

**Page Border Properties**
- `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.View.PageBorderStyle`: Represents the style of the page border.
- `Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.PageBorderDialog`: A dialog to configure page border settings.

### Code Examples

**Setting the Page Border**

```csharp
[C#]
if (diagram1 != null && diagram1.Model != null)
    diagram1.View.PageBorderStyle = PageBorderStyle.ThinLine;
```

### Conclusion

By utilizing the dialog interfaces and associated properties, developers can effectively manage the page setup and border configurations for diagrams in a Windows Forms application.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- The document explains the Overview Control and discusses the Palette GroupBar and GroupView controls.
- Describes how users can drag-and-drop symbols onto a diagram using these controls.
- Explains the classification and maintenance of symbols through the use of GroupBar and GroupView.
- Lists properties and their descriptions for PaletteGroupBar and GroupView.

## Content

### 4.1.2 Palette GroupBar And GroupView

The Palette GroupBar control provides a way for users to drag-and-drop the symbols onto a diagram. It is based on the Syncfusion Essential Tools GroupBar control. Each symbol palette loaded in the PaletteGroupBar occupies a panel that can be selected by a bar button. The bar button is labeled with the name of the symbol palette. The symbols in the palette are shown as icons that can be dragged and dropped onto the diagram. This control allows users to add symbols to a palette, and save or load the palette whenever necessary. It provides a way to classify and maintain the symbols.

The PaletteGroupView control provides an easy way to serialize a symbol palette to and from the resource file of a form. At the design-time, users can attach a symbol palette to a PaletteGroupView control in a form. Selecting the PaletteGroupView, and clicking the Palette property in the Visual Studio .NET properties window, opens a standard Open File dialog, which allows the user to select a symbol palette file that has been created using the Symbol Designer.

The properties of the PaletteGroupBar and GroupView with their descriptions are given in the below table.

| Property    | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| BackColor   | Sets the background color of the component.  |

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes functionality related to handling nodes and selection in the Diagram control.
- Explains the use of the Document Explorer for managing diagram models and nodes.
- Discusses the Property Editor for editing node properties in the Windows Forms environment.

## Content

### Handling Node Selection and Editing

```csharp
{
    Node nodeTemp = e.Node.Tag as Node;
    if (nodeTemp != null)
    {
        if (nodeTemp.Visible &&
            nodeTemp.Root.Equals(this.diagram1.Model))
        {
            diagram1.View.SelectionList.Clear();
            diagram1.View.SelectionList.Add(e.Node.Tag as Node);
        }
        else
        {
            propertyEditor.PropertyGrid.SelectedObject = nodeTemp;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Node Handling**: The code snippet demonstrates how to handle mouse events (`e`) to select and edit nodes in the Diagram control.
- **Selection Logic**: If the node is visible and its root model matches the current `diagram1.Model`, it is added to the selection list.
- **Property Editing**: If the node does not belong to the current diagram, it is selected for property editing in the `propertyEditor.PropertyGrid`.

### Document Explorer

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Depicts a hierarchical flow visualization in a **Left-to-Right** orientation with a **270 degree rotation angle**.
- Highlights the interconnections between different levels of a structure using a visual diagram.
- Represents a **top-down hierarchical relationship** with multiple pathways and connections.

## Content

### Hierarchical Flow Diagram

The diagram shows a **tree-like structure** with nodes connected in a step-by-step fashion from left to right. The key elements are as follows:

- **Central Initiator Node**: A **red rectangular node** at the center-left, serving as the starting point for all pathways.
- **Intermediate Green Nodes**: Multiple **green rectangular nodes** on the left, representing intermediate steps or levels.
- **Pink Termination Nodes**: Each green node is connected to at least one **pink rectangular node** on the right, signifying endpoints or results.
- **Arrows and Connections**: **Arrows** clearly denote the flow direction from green nodes to pink nodes, emphasizing the connections and dependencies.

#### Description of the Diagram Layout
- **Left-to-Right Flow**: All pathways originate from the central red node and progress horizontally until they connect to a pink termination node.
- **270 Degree Rotation**: The orientation demonstrates how the flow visualization can be presented at an angle, enhancing readability and emphasizing certain pathways.

#### Key Observations
- The **central red node** acts as a key hub, branching out to different paths.
- The **green nodes** represent various stages or points, each potentially initiating a new set of connected paths.
- The **pink nodes** at the end signify the final states or outcomes in the flow.

### Interpretation

This **hierarchical diagram** is a visual representation often used in software development, business workflows, or process documentation to clearly demonstrate dependencies and flow. The **270 degree rotation angle** provides a unique perspective, making it easier to trace pathways and understand connections in complex systems.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This section provides an introduction to the Subgraph Layout Manager used in Windows Forms, focusing on enabling distinct orientations for subgraph nodes.
- Describes the implementation and functionality of the `SubgraphTreeLayoutManager` to manage layout positioning.

## Content

### 4.5.1.7 Subgraph Layout Manager

The SubgraphTreeLayoutManager enables the sub nodes of a diagram layout tree to have an orientation that is distinct from the parent node. The subgraph orientation is specified using a SubgraphPreferredLayout event that the layout manager raises before positioning each set of sub nodes in the graph.

The event of the SubgraphLayoutManager class is as follows:

| Event                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SubgraphPreferredLayout   | Event that the layout manager raises before positioning each set of sub nodes in the graph. |

Programmatically, it is implemented as follows.

#### Code Implementation

##### C#
```csharp
SubgraphTreeLayoutManager st = new SubgraphTreeLayoutManager(this.diagram1.Model, 0, 20, 20);
st.SubgraphPreferredLayout += new SubgraphPreferredLayoutEventHandler(st_SubgraphPreferredLayout);
this.diagram1.LayoutManager = st;
this.diagram1.LayoutManager.UpdateLayout(null);
this.diagram1.UpdateView();

private void st_SubgraphPreferredLayout(object sender, SubgraphPreferredLayoutEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    evtArgs.ResizeSubgraphNodes = false;
    evtArgs.RotationDegree = 0;
}
```

##### VB
```vb
Dim st As New SubgraphTreeLayoutManager(Me.diagram1.Model, 0, 20, 20)
AddHandler st.SubgraphPreferredLayout, AddressOf st_SubgraphPreferredLayout
Me.diagram1.LayoutManager = st

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Introduced ability to set margins for diagrams using layout managers, except for Symmetric and Table Layout Manager.
- Improved performance of layout managers by reducing the time taken to lay out a diagram.

## Content

### Setting Margins for Diagrams

For all the Layout Managers supported by Essential Diagram, except **Symmetric and Table Layout Manager**, it is now possible to set the left and right margins for the graph that can be laid out by the layout manager. The two new properties, i.e., **TopMargin** and **LeftMargin** of the Layout Manager will set the margin for the graph using the following code snippet.

- **C#**
```csharp
OrgChartLayoutManager manager = new OrgChartLayoutManager(this.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50);
manager.LeftMargin = 50;
manager.TopMargin = 50;
```

- **VB**
```vb
Dim manager As New OrgChartLayoutManager(Me.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50)
manager.LeftMargin = 50
manager.TopMargin = 50
```

### Improving performance

The performance of most of the Essential Diagram Layout Managers is now improved to a great extent. The time taken for laying out a diagram, using a Layout Manager can now be reduced by setting the **ImprovePerformance** property to **true**.

- **C#**
```csharp
OrgChartLayoutManager manager = new OrgChartLayoutManager(this.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50);
manager.ImprovePerformance = true;
```

- **VB**
```vb
Dim manager As New OrgChartLayoutManager(Me.diagram.Model, RotateDirection.TopToBottom, 20, 50)
manager.ImprovePerformance = True
```

## API Reference (if applicable)
- Namespace: EssentialDiagram.LayoutManagers
- Class: LayoutManager
- Members:
  - **TopMargin**: Sets the top margin for the graph.
  - **LeftMargin**: Sets the left margin for the graph.
  - **ImprovePerformance**: Improves the performance of the layout manager by reducing the time taken to lay out the diagram.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- The provided code snippets demonstrate how to set margins and improve performance using the **OrgChartLayoutManager** class in both C# and VB.NET.

#### Figure 92: Default Handle Edit mode with Resize

<p align="center">
  ![Default Handle Edit mode with Resize](<FIGURE-IMAGE-URL>)
</p>

This figure shows the shape after it has been resized using the handles. The resizing maintains the aspect ratio, as demonstrated in the figure.

### Explanation of Handle Functionality

- **Handles**: The yellow square around the shape and the green circles represent the resizing handles.
- **Resize Operation**: Users can resize the shape by dragging any of the handles. The central handle allows uniform resizing.
- **Behavior During Resize**: The shape maintains its integrity, ensuring that the resizing is predictable and controlled.

## API Reference

This section provides a reference to the APIs and functions related to handling shape resizing in the Diagram control.

## Code Examples

### Example: Enabling Default Handle Edit Mode
```csharp
// Enabling Default Handle Edit Mode
diagram.DefaultHandleEditMode = true;

// Adding a shape
Shape shape = new Shape();
shape.Bounds = new RectangleF(100, 100, 200, 200);
diagram.Shapes.Add(shape);
```

### Example: Handling Resize Events
```csharp
// Handling Resize Events
diagram.Resize += (sender, e) =>
{
    MessageBox.Show("Shape is being resized.");
};
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- This page discusses the concept of node collection events in the context of a simple flow diagram.
- It showcases two types of events: `Node Collection Changing Event` and `Node Collection Changed Event`.
- These events are demonstrated using flow diagrams and corresponding dialog boxes.

## Content

### Simple Flow Diagram

#### Figure 126: Node Collection Changing Event
- **Diagram Description**: 
  - The flow diagram starts with a "START" node.
  - A message box appears indicating that the `NodeCollectionChanging event fired`.
  - The process node follows the start node.

#### Figure 127: Node Collection Changed Event
- **Diagram Description**:
  - A similar flow diagram is shown, with the "START" node leading to a "PROCESS" node.
  - A dialog box indicates that a "Node added" event has occurred.
  - The flow concludes with a "CHECK" node.

## API Reference

The diagram demonstrates two key events related to node collections in Diagrams:

### NodeCollectionChanging Event
- Triggered when the node collection is about to change. This can be used for validation or to prevent modifications.

### NodeCollectionChanged Event
- Triggered after a change has been made to the node collection. This can be used for updates or notifications.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

- **Navigation**: 
  - This page focuses on the node collection events within the Diagram control of Syncfusion WinForms.

### Overview

**Scope:** This page explains the handling of flip and rotation events in the Syncfusion diagram control. It introduces events like `FlipChanging`, `FlipChanged`, `RotationChanging`, and `RotationChanged`, and shows how to programmatically attach event handlers to respond to these events.

## Content

The `FlipEventArgs` structure and rotation events are used to manage changes in the orientation of nodes in the diagram. Below is an overview of how these events are typically handled in code.

### Event Handling for Flip and Rotation

#### Event Details

- **FlipChanging**: Triggered before the node is flipped, allowing you to cancel or modify the flip.
- **FlipChanged**: Triggered after the node is flipped.
- **RotationChanging**: Triggered before a node's rotation is changed.
- **RotationChanged**: Triggered after a node's rotation has been changed.

#### Sample Code: Handling Rotation Events

The following example demonstrates how to attach event handlers for `RotationChanged` and `FlipChanged` events in C#:

```csharp
[C#]

public void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).FlipChanged += new FlipChangedEventHandler(Form1_FlipChanged);
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).FlipChanging += new FlipChangingEventHandler(Form1_FlipChanging);
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).RotationChanged += new RotationChangedEventHandler(Form1_RotationChanged);
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).RotationChanging += new RotationChangingEventHandler(Form1_RotationChanging);

    // Circle
    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Ellipse circle = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Ellipse(0, 0, 96, 72);
    circle.Name = "Circle";
    circle.FillStyle.Type = FillStyleType.LinearGradient;
    circle.FillStyle.ForeColor = Color.AliceBlue;
    circle.ShadowStyle.Visible = true;
    model4.AppendChild(circle);
}

void Form1_RotationChanged(RotationChangedEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    MessageBox.Show("RotationChanged event is fired" + "\n" + evtArgs.RotationOffset.ToString());
}
```

### Explanation

- **Adding Event Handlers**: Event handlers are added to the `FlipChanged`, `FlipChanging`, `RotationChanged`, and `RotationChanging` events using a delegate.
- **Creating a Circle Node**: A circle node is created with specified dimensions, filled with a linear gradient, and a shadow style is applied. This node is then appended to the diagram model.
- **Handling Rotation Changes**: The `Form1_RotationChanged` method is triggered when the rotation of the node changes. It displays a message indicating the event firing along with the rotation offset.

## API Reference

### Events

#### RotationChangedEventArgs

- **Properties**
  - **RotationOffset**: Returns the angle by which the node was rotated.
  - **NodeAffected**: Returns the node's name by which the node was affected.

#### FlipEventArgs

- **Properties**
  - **Cancel**: Indicates whether the flip action should be canceled.
  - **FlipAxis**: Indicates the axis around which the node was flipped.
  - **FlipValue**: Indicates the new boolean value of the `Flip` property.
  - **NodeAffected**: Indicates the node's name by which the node was affected.

## Code Examples

### Handling Rotation Events Example

The following example demonstrates programmatic handling of rotation events in a Syncfusion diagram:

```csharp
public void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).RotationChanged += new RotationChangedEventHandler(Form1_RotationChanged);
}

void Form1_RotationChanged(RotationChangedEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    MessageBox.Show("RotationChanged event is fired" + "\n" + evtArgs.RotationOffset.ToString());
}
```

### Handling Flip Events Example

```csharp
public void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ((DocumentEventSink)model1.EventSink).FlipChanging += new FlipChangingEventHandler(Form1_FlipChanging);
}

void Form1_FlipChanging(FlipChangingEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    MessageBox.Show("FlipChanging event is fired");
}
```

### Event Handling in Diagrams

Below is the VB.NET code snippet defining event handling for connection changes in a Windows Forms application:

```vb
Public Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    AddHandler DirectCast(model1.EventSink, DocumentEventSink).ConnectionsChanged, AddressOf Form1_ConnectionsChanged
        Dim line As New LineConnector(circle.PinPoint, polygon.PinPoint)
        polygon.CentralPort.TryConnect(line.HeadEndPoint)
        circle.CentralPort.TryConnect(line.TailEndPoint)
        model1.AppendChild(line)
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_ConnectionsChanged(ByVal evtArgs As CollectionExEventArgs)
    MessageBox.Show(evtArgs.ChangeType.ToString())
End Sub
```

### Sample Diagram

The sample diagram visualizes the connection event functionality:

## 5.13 How To Detect Whether a New Symbol Or Shape Has Been Added / Removed From A Diagram

You can make use of the `Diagram.Model.EventSink.NodeCollectionChanged` to detect whether a new node (symbol, shape or link) has been added/removed from a diagram. The event's `CollectionExEventArgs` argument provides information about the node ensuing the add / remove operation.

The following code snippet updates a label with information on the type of the node that is added/deleted from the diagram.

```C#
diagram1.Model.EventSink.NodeCollectionChanged += new CollectionExEventHandler(EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged);

//ChildrenChangeComplete Event
//Update Label2 depending on whether a Shape is added or deleted from the Diagram
```

## API Reference (if applicable)

### Methods
- `EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged`
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `object sender`: The source of the event.
    - `EventArgs e`: Event data indicating the operation (add or delete) and the node type.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

### C#
```csharp
diagram1.Model.EventSink.NodeCollectionChanged += new CollectionExEventHandler(EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged);

void EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Implementation to handle node addition or deletion
}
```

### VB.NET
```vb
diagram1.Model.EventSink.NodeCollectionChanged += New CollectionExEventHandler(AddressOf EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged)

Sub EventSink_NodeCollectionChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    ' Implementation to handle node addition or deletion
End Sub
```

        using (SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Yellow))
        {
            // if endpoint is connected with port -- fill its interiors with red
            if (endpoint.Port != null)
            {
                brush.Color = Color.Orange;
            }

            if (!endpoint.AllowMoveX && !endpoint.AllowMoveY)
                brush.Color = Color.Gray;
            // Fill handle interiors
            gfx.FillRectangle(brush, rectHandle);

            // Outline handle
            gfx.DrawRectangle(pen,
                rectHandle.X, rectHandle.Y, rectHandle.Width,
                rectHandle.Height);
        }
    }
}
```

### Parameters

- `gfx`: A `Graphics` object used for drawing.
- `rectHandle`: A `RectangleF` representing the handle's dimensions.
- `endpoint`: An `EndPoint` object representing the endpoint to be drawn.

### Description

The `OnDrawEndPointOutline` method is used to draw the outline and background of the endpoint handle. It provides the flexibility to customize the appearance of the endpoint by overriding the method. The method uses a dashed black pen and a solid yellow brush by default. If the endpoint is connected to a port, the interior is filled with orange. If the endpoint is not allowed to move in either the X or Y direction, the interior is filled with gray.

### Code Example

```csharp
protected override void OnDrawEndPointOutline(Graphics gfx, RectangleF rectHandle, EndPoint endpoint)
{
    using (Pen pen = new Pen(Color.Black))
    {
        pen.Width = 1f / gfx.PageScale;
        pen.DashStyle = DashStyle.Dot;
        using (SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Yellow))
        {
            if (endpoint.Port != null)
            {
                brush.Color = Color.Orange;
            }

            if (!endpoint.AllowMoveX && !endpoint.AllowMoveY)
                brush.Color = Color.Gray;
            gfx.FillRectangle(brush, rectHandle);
            gfx.DrawRectangle(pen,
                rectHandle.X, rectHandle.Y, rectHandle.Width,
                rectHandle.Height);
        }
    }
}
```

## Creating a Rotation Handle

### Summary

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Method creates and returns GraphicsPath that represents rotation handle
/// Override this method to change rotationhandle appearance
/// </summary>
/// <param name="location">Location of rotation handle</param>
/// <param name="handleSize">size of rotation handle</param>
/// <returns></returns>
```

### Parameters

- `location`: The location of the rotation handle.
- `handleSize`: The size of the rotation handle.

### Description

This method is responsible for creating and returning a `GraphicsPath` that represents the rotation handle. It provides the flexibility to customize the appearance of the rotation handle by overriding the method.

### Code Example

```csharp
protected override GraphicsPath CreateRotationHandle(PointF location, SizeF handleSize)
{
    // Implement the logic to create and return the GraphicsPath
    // Example:
    var path = new GraphicsPath();
    path.AddEllipse(location.X, location.Y, handleSize.Width, handleSize.Height);
    return path;
}
```

### 5.16 How To Export a Diagram Into a Word Document

To export a diagram into a Word document, follow the below given steps.

1. Save the diagram in any one of the standard image formats such as bitmaps, enhanced metafiles, SVG format files, and so forth.
2. Export the saved images to the Word document using Essential DocIO.

**Note**: To export the saved images to the Word document, you need to have Essential DocIO installed in your system.

#### Code Example: C#

```csharp
System.Drawing.Image diagramImage = new Bitmap(1, 1, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb);
Graphics grfx = Graphics.FromImage(diagramImage);
IntPtr hdc = grfx.GetHdc();
Metafile emf = new Metafile(hdc, EmfType.EmfOnly);
Graphics emfGrfx = Graphics.FromImage(emf);
this.diagram1.View.ExportDiagramToGraphics(emfGrfx, true);
grfx.ReleaseHdc(hdc);
grfx.Dispose();
emfGrfx.Dispose();
diagramImage.Dispose();
WordDocument document = new WordDocument();

// Adding a new section to the document.
IWSection section = document.AddSection();

// Adding a paragraph to the section.
IWParagraph paragraph = section.AddParagraph();
WPicture mImage = (WPicture)paragraph.AppendPicture(emf);
document.Save("Sample.doc", Syncfusion.DocIO.FormatType.Doc);
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("Sample.doc");
```

#### Code Example: VB.NET

Dim ptGridNearestPoint As PointF =
    diagram1.View.Grid.GetNearestGridPoint(ptMouse, rulerHeight)
```

### 5.20 How To Hide Handles Completely From the Nodes

We can hide the handles completely by setting the `HandleColor` and `HandleOutlineColor` properties to `'Transparent'` as follows.

#### Implementation

```csharp
[C#]
this.diagram1.View.HandleColor = Color.Transparent;
this.diagram1.View.HandleOutlineColor = Color.Transparent;
```

```vb
[VB.NET]
Me.diagram1.View.HandleColor = Color.Transparent
Me.diagram1.View.HandleOutlineColor = Color.Transparent
```

### 5.23 How To Prevent the Nodes From Being Rotated

This can be done by raising the `Diagram.Model.EventSink.RotationChanging` event and cancelling the operation.

#### C#

```csharp
this.diagram1.Model.EventSink.RotationChanging += new RotationChangingEventHandler(EventSink_RotationChanging);

void EventSink_RotationChanging(RotationChangingEventArgs evtArgs)
{
    evtArgs.Cancel = true;
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Me.diagram1.Model.EventSink.RotationChanging += New RotationChangingEventHandler(EventSink_RotationChanging)

Private Sub EventSink_RotationChanging(ByVal evtArgs As Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.RotationChangingEventArgs)
    evtArgs.Cancel = True
End Sub
```

### 5.24 How To Print a Diagram In a Single Page

Essential Diagram uses the size of your diagram model and the printer page settings for calculating the number of pages to be rendered while printing. Even though you might have only one page worth of nodes in your diagram model, if the model bounds are larger, the Diagram control will attempt to paginate and print the entire model.

To print the diagram in a single page, you have to temporarily modify the size of the model.

#### C#

```csharp
// The desired page size is 21 x 29.7 centimeters.
```

## 5.28 How To Retrieve the Port Information Of a Particular Symbol

You can retrieve port information of a particular symbol using the `HandlesHitTesting.GetConnectionPointAtPoint(Node, Point)` method.

This method has two parameters: `Node` and `Point`.

- `Node` specifies the symbol in which the port resides.
- `Point` specifies the `Point` object that holds the location of the port.

### C#

```csharp
ConnectionPoint port = HandlesHitTesting.GetConnectionPointAtPoint(circle, new Point(120, 120));
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- How to programmatically move nodes on a diagram.
- Steps to remove the gray area around a diagram.

## Content

### How to Move Nodes on a Diagram Programmatically?
You can move the desired collection of nodes to a diagram using the `MoveNodes` method. The following code example illustrates this.

```csharp
[C#]

// Move the selected nodes by 20 pixels in both horizontally and vertically.
diagram1.MoveNodes(diagram1.Controller.SelectionList, 20, 20, MeasureUnits.Pixel);
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

' Move the selected nodes by 20 pixels in both horizontally and vertically.
diagram1.MoveNodes(diagram1.Controller.SelectionList, 20, 20, MeasureUnits.Pixel)
```

### How to Remove the Gray Area around a Diagram?
You can remove the unnecessary gray area added around a diagram by setting the `ScrollVirtualBounds` property as `Empty`. The following code example illustrates this.

```csharp
[C#]

// Remove the unwanted gray area around a diagram.
diagram1.View.ScrollVirtualBounds = RectangleF.Empty;
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]

' Remove the unwanted gray area around a diagram.
diagram1.View.ScrollVirtualBounds = RectangleF.Empty;
```

## API Reference

### Parameters for `MoveNodes` Method
- **Node Selection**: The collection of nodes to move, typically obtained from `diagram1.Controller.SelectionList`.
- **Horizontal Offset**: The number of pixels to move horizontally.
- **Vertical Offset**: The number of pixels to move vertically.
- **Measure Unit**: The unit of measurement, specified as `MeasureUnits.Pixel`.

### Properties
- **ScrollVirtualBounds**: Property of the diagram's view that defines the bounds of the diagram area.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

```vb
Dim paletteToReturn As SymbolPalette = Nothing
Dim strFileName As String = "Basic Flowchart Shapes.vss"
'Create an instance of VisioStencilConverter
Dim converter As VisioStencilConverter = New VisioStencilConverter(strFileName)
converter.ShowProgressDialog = True
'Convert the stencil as SymbolPalette
paletteToReturn = converter.Convert()
paletteGroupBar1.AddPalette(paletteToReturn)
```

**Note:** You must have Visio installed in your machine to import the stencils.

## 5.39 How to Get a Node at a Point or under a Mouse Location?

### GetNodeAtPoint

You can use the `GetNodeAtPoint` method of `Controller` to get a node at a point. You have to convert the point to a model coordinate before using this method in order to get the exact result when a diagram document is panned and zoomed.

#### C#

```csharp
//Client location.
Point pt = new Point(200, 150);
//Convert client location to model location.
pt = diagram1.Controller.ConvertToModelCoordinates(pt);
//Get the node in model coordinates.
Node node = diagram1.Controller.GetNodeAtPoint(pt);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
'Client location.
Dim pt As Point = New Point(200, 150)
'Convert client location to model location.
pt = diagram1.Controller.ConvertToModelCoordinates(pt)
'Get the node in model coordinates.
Dim node As Node = diagram1.Controller.GetNodeAtPoint(pt)
```

### GetNodeUnderMouse

You can use the `GetNodeUnderMouse` method of `Controller` to get a node at a current mouse point. You don't have to convert the mouse point to a model coordinate while using this method. You just need to pass the current mouse point to the model coordinate.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

- Overview Control provides a dynamic interface for diagram management, allowing users to pan and zoom.
- PaletteGroupBar and GroupView enable users to manage and drag symbols onto diagrams.
- Property Editor displays and modifies properties of diagram objects.
- Document Explorer visualizes details of objects added to the diagram at runtime.
- DiagramDocument encapsulates model and view data for diagrams.

## Content

### 1. Overview Control

Overview Control provides a perspective view of a diagram model, and allows users to dynamically pan and zoom the diagrams. The control features a view port window that can be moved and / or resized using the mouse to modify the diagrams' origin and magnification properties at run-time. The properties of this control is discussed in the **Overview Control** topic.

### 2. Palette GroupBar and GroupView

The PaletteGroupBar control provides a way for users to drag and drop symbols onto a diagram. It is based on the Syncfusion Essential Tools GroupBar control. Each symbol palette loaded in the PaletteGroupBar occupies a panel that can be selected by a bar button. The bar button is labeled with the name of the symbol palette. The symbols in the palette are shown as icons that can be dragged and dropped onto the diagram. This control allows users to add symbols to a palette, and save or load the palette whenever necessary. It provides a way to classify and maintain symbols.

The PaletteGroupView control provides an easy way to serialize a symbol palette to and from the resource file of a form. At design-time, users can attach a symbol palette to a PaletteGroupView control in the form. Selecting the PaletteGroupView and clicking the Palette property in the Visual Studio .NET Properties window will open a standard Open File dialog, which allows the user to select a symbol palette file that has been created with the Symbol Designer.

For more details about these diagram controls, refer to the **Palette GroupBar and GroupView** topic.

### 3. Property Editor

The Property Editor in Essential Diagram displays properties of the currently selected object(s) in the diagram. It is a Windows Forms control that can be added to the Visual Studio .NET Toolbox. It also allows users to set or modify various properties of the objects or the model. The Property Editor provides an easy interface to set and view the various property settings. To know about the control's properties see **Property Editor** topic.

### 4. Document Explorer

**Document Explorer** allows you to visualize the details of the various objects that are added onto the diagram control at run-time. The layers will be listed under the **Layers** node and other objects like shapes, links, lines and text editor will be listed under **Nodes** node.

### 5. Diagram Document

The DiagramDocument is a serializable document type that encapsulates the model and view data for the diagram. The grid area of the diagram document is the diagram view object area. The nodes dragged from the PaletteGroupBar will be dropped here.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

```csharp
groupBarItem1.Client = paletteGroupView1
groupBarItem1.Text = "Basic Shapes"
groupBarItem2.Client = paletteGroupView2
groupBarItem2.Text = "ElectricalSymbols"

paletteGroupView1.ButtonView = True
paletteGroupView1.Location = New System.Drawing.Point(2, 24)
paletteGroupView1.Name = "paletteGroupView1"
paletteGroupView1.Size = New System.Drawing.Size(71, 0)
paletteGroupView1.TabIndex = 0

paletteGroupView1.Text = "paletteGroupView1"

paletteGroupView1.LoadPalette("..\..\..\..\..\Common\Data\Diagram\BasicShapes.edp")
paletteGroupView2.LoadPalette("..\..\..\..\..\Common\Data\Diagram\ElectricalSymbols.edp")
```

## Dynamically add Symbol Palette into PaletteGroupBar

You can add Symbol Palettes into PaletteGroupBar by means of deserializing the palette (*.edp) file dynamically. The PaletteGroupBar control supports `PaletteGroupBar1.AddPalette()` method in order to add a palette into the PaletteGroupBar.

Follow the steps given below for adding symbol palette into PaletteGroupBar:

1. Add OpenFileDialog control into form.
2. Set the `Filter` property of OpenFileDialog as,
   ```
   Essential Diagram Palettes|*.edp|Visio Stencils|*.vss; *.vsx|Visio Drawings(Shapes only)|*.vsd; *.vdx|All files|*.*
   ```
3. Add the following lines of code to your button click event.

### WinForms-specific Conventions
- Control names and namespaces are used exactly, such as `paletteGroupView1`, `groupBarItem1`, and `openPaletteDialog`.
- The code demonstrates interactive file selection and palette addition using the OpenFileDialog.

### Notes
- Ensure that the file paths are correct and accessible for the `LoadPalette` method.
- The example uses `C#` syntax for clarity and compatibility with Syncfusion Winforms.

## Code Examples

```csharp
if (openPaletteDialog.ShowDialog(this) == DialogResult.OK)
{
    SymbolPalette curSymbolPalette;
    FileStream iStream;
    string strFileName = openPaletteDialog.FileName;
    RegexOptions options = RegexOptions.IgnoreCase |
}
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Modifies the appearance of connectors (Orthogonal, Org line, Polyline) by adding rounded corners.
- Uses `EnableRoundedCorner` to enable rounded corners and `CurveRadius` to set the radius for the rounded corner curve.
- Useful for customizing the visual style of connectors.

## Content

### 4.3.1 Rounded Corner

You can now change the look of connectors (Orthogonal, Org line, Polyline) by providing rounded corners to connectors.

The `EnableRoundedCorner` is used to enable rounded corner for a connector, and the `CurveRadius` connector property is used and set the radius for the rounded corner curve respectively.

#### Use Case Scenario

This is used to change the visual style of connectors.

#### Properties

| Property                | Description                                                 | Data Type |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| EnableRoundedCorner     | Enables or disables rounded corner for a connector.         | bool      |
| CurveRadius             | Gets or sets the radius for the rounded corner curve of a connector. | float     |

The following code illustrates how to change the look of a connector by using the `EnableRoundedCorner` and `CurveRadius` properties.

```csharp
[C#]
OrthogonalConnector orthogonal = new OrthogonalConnector(new PointF(100, 100), new PointF(300, 300));
// Enables rounded corner for the connector.
orthogonal.EnableRoundedCorner = true;
// Sets the radius of the rounded corner curve.
orthogonal.CurveRadius = 10;
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(orthogonal);
```

```vb
[VB]
Dim orthogonal As New OrthogonalConnector(New PointF(100, 100), New Point(300, 300))
'Enables rounded corner for the connector.
orthogonal.EnableRoundedCorner = True
'Sets the radius of the rounded corner curve.
orthogonal.CurveRadius = 10
diagram1.Model.AppendChild(orthogonal)
```

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

### 4.5.1.6 Graph Layout Manager

The `GraphLayoutManager` is an abstract base class that can be used for implementing layout managers for diagrams composed primarily of nodes forming connected graphs. The `GraphLayoutManager` implements the infrastructure for initializing, validating, and creating the diagram graph by enumerating the diagram model's child nodes. It also enables positioning diagram nodes using the layout strategies provided by specialized directed tree layout managers that derive from it.

The event of the `Graph Layout Manager` class and its description is given below:

| Event                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PreferredLayout Event | Event provides the application a chance to customize the layout of the diagram. |

**Programmatically, it is implemented as follows.**
```csharp

```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Explains how to manage layers in Windows Forms.
- Describes the properties and functionalities associated with adding and managing layers.
- Highlights the process of adding objects to specific layers and controlling object visibility.

## Content

### Adding Layers
Layers can be added to the model through **LayersCollectionEditor**, which can be opened by selecting the **Layers Collection** property.

| Properties | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Enabled    | Indicates whether the layer should be active or not. Default value is `False`. |
| Name       | Indicates whether the unit should be inherited. |
| Visible    | Indicates whether the objects on the layer should be visible. |

#### Adding Objects to a Layer
- To add objects to a layer, that layer must be active. If an object is added to the model, it will be automatically added to that active layer.
- The layer can be made active only by setting the **Enabled** property of that layer.
- Objects can be added to more than one layer by setting the **Enabled** property of all the layers to which it is added.
- To add an object only to a single layer, make sure that only a single layer is enabled at a time.

#### Object Visibility
- Controls the visibility of objects on specific layers.

## Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

### Adjusting Vertical Ruler Text Style

By modifying the `VerticalRuler.TextStyle` properties in a Syncfusion Diagram control for Windows Forms, you can customize the appearance of the vertical ruler. Here are the properties and their settings:

```csharp
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Bold = True
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Italic = True
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.PointSize = 20
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Strikout = True
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Style = System.Drawing.FontStyle.Bold
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Underline = True
Me.diagram1.VerticalRuler.TextStyle.Unit = MeasureUnits.Point
```

#### Sample Diagram

The resulting vertical ruler with these settings is shown in the following diagram:

![](https://i.imgur.com/vertical_ruler_sample.png)

**Figure 111: Vertical ruler Property Settings**

### Customizing Horizontal Ruler Properties

The same properties can be set separately for the horizontal ruler by using `HorizontalRuler` instead of `VerticalRuler`. Here's how to apply the same settings for the horizontal ruler:

```csharp
[C#]
```

## Adjusting Horizontal Ruler Text Style

To apply similar adjustments to the horizontal ruler, replace `VerticalRuler` with `HorizontalRuler` in the property settings as shown above.

#### Example: Setting Horizontal Ruler Properties

The following code snippet demonstrates how to customize the horizontal ruler's text style properties:

```csharp
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Bold = True
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Italic = True
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.PointSize = 20
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Strikout = True
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Style = System.Drawing.FontStyle.Bold
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Underline = True
Me.diagram1.HorizontalRuler.TextStyle.Unit = MeasureUnits.Point
```

### Summary

By adjusting the `TextStyle` properties of both vertical and horizontal rulers in a Syncfusion Diagram control for Windows Forms, you can control the font, size, style, and other visual aspects of the ruler text. This allows for a customized and professional appearance tailored to your application's needs.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes special methods available when working with Groups in Diagram forms.
- Explains how to manage child nodes, including adding, removing, and positioning them.
- Discusses child count properties and methods to interact with Group nodes.

## Content

### Group Node Methods and Properties

If the node is a Group, the following are some special methods:

```csharp
public Node GetChild(int childIndex);
public Node GetChildByName(string childName);
public void RemoveAllChildren();
public bool RemoveChild(int childIndex);
public bool RemoveChild(Node nodeToRemove);
public void InsertChild(Node child, int childIndex);
```

Also, Group has an `int ChildCount` property, which returns the child count in a Group. To delete the first element in a Group, use the below code:

```csharp
foreach (Node node in Diagraml.Model.Nodes)
{
    if (node is Group) // Check for Group
    {
        Group groupNode = (Group)node;
        if (groupNode.ChildCount > 0) // Group has sub nodes
        {
            Node nodeToRemove = groupNode.GetChild(0);
            groupNode.RemoveChild(nodeToRemove);
        }
    }
}
```

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- ScrollTips functionality can be enabled or disabled for horizontal and vertical scroll bars using specific properties.
- The format of ScrollTips can be customized programmatically using the ScrollTipFormat property.

## Content

### ScrollTips
ScrollTips can be enabled or disabled for horizontal and vertical scroll bars individually by setting the `HorizontalScrollTips` and `VerticalScrollTips` properties.

The format in which the scrolltip should be displayed can be specified using the `ScrollTipFormat` property. The default format is `'Position{0}'`.

| Properties            | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HorizontalScrollTips` | Specifies whether to display the horizontal scroll bar.                   |
| `VerticalScrollTips`   | Specifies whether to display the vertical scroll bar.                     |
| `ScrollTipFormat`      | Specifies the format for the scrolltip to be displayed.                    |

Programmatically, these properties can be set as follows.

#### C#
```csharp
this.diagram1.HorizontalScrollTips = true;
this.diagram1.VerticalScrollTips = true;
this.diagram1.ScrollTipFormat = "Offset{0}";
```

#### VB
```vb

Me.diagram1.VerticalScrollTips = True
Me.diagram1.ScrollTipFormat = "Offset{0}"
```

### Using Splitter Control

When a Splitter control is used and one or more diagram controls are added, setting the `FillSplitterPane` property docks the diagram control inside the Splitter control and fills the entire space.

| Property          | Description                                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Describes the usage of `OriginChangedEventArgs` to track changes in the origin point in Windows Forms.
- Demonstrates handling the `OriginChanged` event and extracting details such as new origin, offset, and original origin.
- Includes a sample code to illustrate adding event handling for origin changes and adding graphical elements like circles and polygons.

## Content

### WinForms-specific Conventions

The following code example demonstrates adding event handling for the `OriginChanged` event in a Windows Forms application using the Syncfusion library. The event handler updates a text box to display the new and original origin coordinates, as well as the offset between these points.

#### Event Arguments Member Table

| Origin EventArgs Member      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NewOrigin**                | Returns the new X and Y origin values after moving the origin.            |
| **Offset**                   | Returns the difference between the old and new origin.                      |
| **OriginalOrigin**           | Returns the X and Y values before moving the origin.                       |

#### Sample Code

In the following code sample, when the `OriginChanged` event is handled, the various member values are listed in a text box as the control is scrolled accordingly.

```csharp
[C#]

public void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ((DiagramViewerEventSink)diagram1.EventSink).OriginChanged += new ViewOriginEventHandler(Form1_OriginChanged);
    NodeCollection nodeStack = new NodeCollection();

    // Circle

    Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Ellipse circle = new Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Diagram.Ellipse(0, 0, 96, 72);
    circle.Name = "Circle";
    circle.FillStyle.Type = FillStyleType.LinearGradient;
    circle.FillStyle.ForeColor = Color.AliceBlue;
    circle.ShadowStyle.Visible = true;
    nodeStack.Add(circle);

    // Polygon

    Point[] pts = { new Point(6, 36), new Point(48, 6), new Point(90, 36), new Point(48, 66) };
    Polygon polygon = new Polygon(pts);
    polygon.Name = "Polygon";
    polygon.FillStyle.ForeColor = Color.DarkSeaGreen;
    polygon.FillStyle.Color = Color.DarkSeaGreen;
    nodeStack.Add(polygon);

    int i = 0;
    this.model4.AppendChildren(nodeStack, out i);
    MessageBox.Show("Node count = " + "\n" +
}
```

## API Reference

### Events
- **OriginChanged**: Triggered when the origin of the diagram changes.

### Member Variables
- **NewOrigin**: Represents the new X and Y coordinates after the origin is moved.
- **Offset**: Represents the difference between the old and new origin.
- **OriginalOrigin**: Represents the X and Y coordinates before the origin is moved.

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview
- Demonstrates handling events related to ZOrderchanging and ZOrderchanged in Visual Basic.NET.
- Provides sample code for setting event handlers and showing notifications when ZOrder events are triggered.
- Includes a sample diagram illustrating the flow of handling ZOrder changing and checking.

## Content

### Event Handling Example

The following code snippet shows how to handle `ZOrderChanging` and `ZOrderChanged` events in a Windows Forms application using Visual Basic.NET:

```vb
AddHandler DirectCast(model1.EventSink, DocumentEventSink).ZOrderChanged, AddressOf Form1_ZOrderChanged
AddHandler DirectCast(model1.EventSink, DocumentEventSink).ZOrderChanging, AddressOf Form1_ZOrderChanging

diagram1.Controller.BringToFront()
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_ZOrderChanging(ByVal evtArgs As 
ZOrderChangingEventArgs)
    MessageBox.Show(("ZOrderChanging event is fired" & vbCrLf & "Node: ") + 
evtArgs.NodeAffected.Name.ToString())
End Sub

Private Sub Form1_ZOrderChanged(ByVal evtArgs As 
ZOrderChangedEventArgs)
    MessageBox.Show(("ZOrderChanged event is fired" & vbCrLf & "New 
ZOrder: ") + evtArgs.ZOrder.ToString())
End Sub
```

### Sample Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the process flow for handling the `ZOrderChanging` event:

- **START**: The process begins.
- **PROCESS**: The `ZOrderChanging` event is triggered.
- **CHECK**: A notification box shows the event details.
- **END**: The process terminates.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create and render a rotation handle shape and a resize handle shape using the `GraphicsPath` and `Pen` classes in Windows Forms.

#### Code Example: C#

```csharp
public override GraphicsPath CreateRotationHandleShape(PointF location, SizeF handleSize)
{
    RectangleF rect = Geometry.CreateRect(location, handleSize);
    return PathFactory.CreateRoundRectangle(rect, 2);
}

/// <summary>
/// Renders resize handle.
/// Override this method to change appearance of resize handle.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="gfx">Target Graphics</param>
/// <param name="size">size of outlining rectangle</param>
public override void OnDrawResizeHandleShape(Graphics gfx, BoxPosition handle, Node node, RectangleF rectHandle)
{
    using (Pen pen = new Pen(m_handleOutlineColor))
    {
        pen.Width = 1f / gfx.PageScale;
        pen.DashStyle = DashStyle.Solid;
        pen.Color = HandleOutlineColor;

        // Create brush to fill PinPoint interiors
        using (Brush brush =
            (!Enabled(handle, node) ? new SolidBrush(Color.Red) : new SolidBrush(Color.Green)))
        {
            using (GraphicsPath gp = PathFactory.CreateRoundRectangle(rectHandle, 3))
            {
                gfx.FillPath(brush, gp);
                // Outline handle
                gfx.DrawPath(pen, gp);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Code Example: VB.NET

```vb
Public Class MyHandleRenderer
    Inherits UserHandleRenderer
    '

# Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

## Overview

- This section demonstrates how to dynamically update node colors using the `MouseMove` event in a Windows Forms application.
- It highlights the use of a timer to trigger continuous random color changes for selected polygons.
- Utilizes `Node` and `Polygon` types from the Diagram control.

## Content

### Handling Mouse Movement

The `diagram1_MouseMove` event handler retrieves the node under the mouse and updates the tooltip and timer based on the node's properties.

```csharp
[C#]

Node globalNode;
Polygon PolygonNode;
public Timer timer1;

private void diagram1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        // Retrieves node under the mouse action
        Node node1 = (Node)this.diagram1.Controller.GetNodeUnderMouse(new Point(e.X, e.Y));

        if (node1 != null && (node1.Name.ToString() != "TextNode"))
        {
            this.toolTip1.SetToolTip(this.diagram1, node1.Name);
            this.toolTip1.Active = true;

            globalNode = node1;
            PolygonNode = node1 as Polygon;
            defaultColor = PolygonNode.FillStyle.Color;

            this.timer1.Start();
        }
        else
        {
            this.toolTip1.Active = false;
            this.timer1.Stop();
        }
    }
    catch
    {
    }
}
```

### Timer Tick Event

The `timer1_Tick` event handler changes the fill color of the selected polygon using a random color generator.

```csharp
private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Convert node as polygon
    Polygon poly = globalNode as Polygon;
    Random r = new Random();

    if (poly != null)
    {
        // Setting fillstyle for the polygon
        poly.FillStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(r.Next(255), r.Next(255), r.Next(255));
        globalNode.LineStyle.DashStyle = 
    }
}
```

## Notes

- The `globalNode` variable is used to store the selected node during mouse movement.
- The `PolygonNode` variable is cast to access polygon-specific properties like `FillStyle`.
- The `timer1` timer is used to trigger continuous updates to the polygon's fill color.
- The `Random` class is employed to generate random colors for the polygon's fill style.

### 5.29 How To Serialize the Custom Property Of a Node

Essential Diagram supports custom serialization. To serialize the custom property, you should derive the `Group` class and create a custom node. After creating a custom node, you should override the `GetObjectData()` method and add the custom property in the `SerializationInfo`. This is illustrated in the below code snippet.

#### C#
```csharp
[Serializable()]
public class CustomNode : Group
{
    protected CustomNode(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context)
    {
        this.m_nodeInformation = info.GetString("strDescription");
    }
    protected override void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        base.GetObjectData(info, context);

        // Additional member variables are serialized here.
        info.AddValue("strDescription", this.NodeInformation);
    }
}
```

#### VB.NET
```vbnet
<Serializable()>
Public Class CustomNode
    Inherits Group
    Public Sub New()
    End Sub

    Protected Sub New(ByVal info As SerializationInfo, ByVal context As StreamingContext)
        MyBase.New(info, context)
        Me.m_nodeInformation = info.GetString("strDescription")
    End Sub
End Class
```

## API Reference

### Constructors
- `CustomNode(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`  
  Initializes a new instance of the `CustomNode` class.

### Methods
- `GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`  
  Called by the formatter to populate a `SerializationInfo` with the data needed to serialize the object.

## Code Examples

### C#
```csharp
[Serializable()]
public class CustomNode : Group
{
    public string NodeInformation { get; protected set; }

    protected CustomNode(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context) : base(info, context)
    {
        NodeInformation = info.GetString("strDescription");
    }

    protected override void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        base.GetObjectData(info, context);
        info.AddValue("strDescription", NodeInformation);
    }
}
```

### VB.NET
```vbnet
<Serializable()>
Public Class CustomNode
    Inherits Group

    Public Property NodeInformation As String

    Public Sub New(ByVal info As SerializationInfo, ByVal context As StreamingContext)
        MyBase.New(info, context)
        NodeInformation = info.GetString("strDescription")
    End Sub

    Protected Overloads Overrides Sub GetObjectData(ByVal info As SerializationInfo, ByVal context As StreamingContext)
        MyBase.GetObjectData(info, context)
        info.AddValue("strDescription", NodeInformation)
    End Sub
End Class
```

## Essential Diagram for Windows Forms

### Interaction with Nodes

The provided code examples demonstrate how to retrieve the top node under the current mouse location in a diagram within a Windows Forms application. This functionality is useful for interactive UI elements where precise node identification is required based on mouse movement.

#### C# Code Example

```csharp
private void diagram1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // Gets the top node under the current mouse location.
    INode node = diagram1.Controller.GetNodeUnderMouse(e.Location);
}
```

#### VB.NET Code Example

```vb.net
Private Sub diagram1_MouseMove(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs)
    ' Gets the top node under the current mouse location.
    Dim node As INode = diagram1.Controller.GetNodeUnderMouse(e.Location)
End Sub
```

### Functionality Explanation

In both code examples, the `diagram1_MouseMove` event handler is triggered when the mouse moves over the diagram control (`diagram1`). The `GetNodeUnderMouse` method retrieves the topmost node located at the current mouse position (`e.Location`). This is particularly useful for implementing hover effects, selection mechanics, or node-specific actions based on user interactions.

### API Reference

- **Controller.GetNodeUnderMouse(PointF location)**
  - **Parameters:**
    - `location`: Type `PointF` representing the mouse position in the diagram's coordinate system.
  - **Return Type:**
    - `INode`: The topmost node located at the specified mouse position. If no node is found, it returns `null`.
  - **Purpose:**
    - Identifies the node at a specific location within the diagram, enabling interaction with the node based on mouse actions.

### Code Examples in Context

The provided examples illustrate how to integrate the `GetNodeUnderMouse` functionality into a Windows Forms application. Both C# and VB.NET implementations achieve the same result but are tailored to the respective language syntax conventions.
