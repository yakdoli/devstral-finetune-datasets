## Content

### Problems with Using Excel as a Reporting Component

MS Excel was not designed to be a report generation library, so it has several disadvantages compared to XlsIO. Here is a list of some of the problems in using Excel as a reporting component:

- **Microsoft's Recommendation**: Microsoft themselves do not recommend using Excel as a report generation server-side component. The reasons are clearly explained in the following Knowledge Base article from Microsoft: [http://support.microsoft.com](http://support.microsoft.com).

  **Quote from the Article**:
  > "Microsoft does not currently recommend, and does not support, Automation of Microsoft Office applications from any unattended, non-interactive client application or component (including ASP, DCOM, and NT Services), because Office may exhibit unstable behavior and/or deadlock when run in this environment."

- **Speed**: Excel automation is about 100 times slower than Essential XlsIO while generating reports.

- **Cost**: Licensing XlsIO is much cheaper than MS Excel licensing options. Here is a link to a Knowledge Base article from Microsoft: [http://support.microsoft.com](http://support.microsoft.com).

- **Usability**:
  - Essential XlsIO has a very intuitive object model that is modeled after the Excel object model, making it easy to work.
  - XlsIO also includes some additional helper functionalities like the `ImportDataTable` method, which makes programming with XlsIO much easier than using COM automation.
  - IntelliSense comments also make the job of programming with XlsIO much easier than Excel automation.

IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2016;

// Create a new workbook and worksheet
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create();
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Load sample data into a DataTable
DataTable dataTable = new DataTable();
dataTable.Columns.Add("Name");
dataTable.Columns.Add("Age");
dataTable.Rows.Add("John Doe", 30);
dataTable.Rows.Add("Jane Smith", 28);

// Import the DataTable into the worksheet
worksheet.ImportDataTable(dataTable, new ExcelImportDataTableOptions
{
    FirstRow = 1,
    FirstColumn = 1,
});

```

Every action result must inherit the base `ActionResult` class. The base `ActionResult` class has one method that you must implement: the `ExecuteResult` method. The `ExecuteResult` method is called to generate the content, created by the action result. This method streams the output Excel file to the browser.

A controller action cannot return an action result directly. For example, if you want to return a view from a controller action, you don't return an object of type `ViewResult`; instead, you call the `View` method. The `View` method instantiates a new object of type `ViewResult` and returns it to the browser.

An extension method named `SaveAsActionResult` has to be created to add the `Controller` class. The `SaveAsActionResult` method returns an object of type, `ExcelResult`.

# Essential XlsIO

```csharp
// Open an existing Excel 2007 file. Note that you should select the ExcelOpenType when opening .xlsx files
IWorkbook workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("Excel2007.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Write data
sheet.Range["C3:O28"].Text = "Hello world";

// Select the version to be saved
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007; // or
// workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;

// Save it as "Excel2007" format.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xlsx");
```

### [VB.NET]

```vb.net
' Open an existing Excel 2007 file. Note that you should select the ExcelOpenType when opening .xlsx files
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("Excel2007.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

' Select the version to be saved.
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007 ' or
' workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

' Write data
sheet.Range("C3:O28").Text = "Hello world"

' Save it as "Excel 2007" format.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xlsx")
```

**Note:** You can use the very same API to work with the xlsx file or any other older format.

You can also set the **default version** of the workbook when you want to work with the same format.

# Essential XlsIO

```csharp
workbook.Close()
excelEngine.Dispose()
```

## Overview

- A list of compression enumerations is provided, explaining the behavior of each option.
- An introduction to SpreadsheetML and its functionality within Excel workbooks.

## Content

Following are the list of enumerations available:

| Enum          | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NoCompression | File will not be compressed.                                                                      |
| BestSpeed     | Fast compression with more size than normal compression.                                          |
| BelowNormal   | Compression speed and size will be between Normal and BestSpeed.                                 |
| Normal        | Both size and speed will be Normal.                                                               |
| AboveNormal   | Takes more time to compress, with reduced file size.                                              |
| Best          | Slow compression, file size reduced to the best level.                                           |

### 3.7.3 SpreadsheetML

SpreadsheetML is an XML dialect developed by Microsoft to represent the information in an Excel workbook. SpreadsheetML allows you to save Excel workbooks as XML documents, and to open them in Excel. Microsoft created a format that allows you to save, in an XML-based file, almost every Excel customization (including formulas, data, and formatting).

SpreadsheetML file can be created with Office 2003 by selecting the **Save as type: as XML Spreadsheet (*.xml)**.

## Essential XlsIO

```csharp
// Saving the workbook to disk.
sheet.SaveAs("Sample.csv",",", Encoding.ASCII);
```

```vb.net
' Saving the workbook to disk.
sheet.SaveAs("Sample.csv",",", Encoding.ASCII)
```

## 3.8 Using Templates

This is the most widely used functionality of XlsIO as it is the easiest and the most convenient to use. An existing spreadsheet is used as a template for generating new spreadsheets. There are several advantages of using the Template-based approach.

- The spreadsheet can be formatted by using the MS Excel GUI, and the data alone can be inserted dynamically by using XlsIO. This saves the problem of writing code for formatting by using the XlsIO API.
- There are some features like VBA Macros which cannot be created by using the XlsIO's API. Even these features can be preserved by XlsIO, when a spreadsheet is opened and saved programmatically.
- Editing an existing data in the spreadsheet is also possible by opening the template with XlsIO.

```csharp
// New instance of XlsIO is created. [Equivalent to launching MS Excel with no workbooks open].
// The instantiation process consists of two steps.

// Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

// Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
```

## Tips to improve the Performance

- Use **default styles**, which can be used to apply styles for the whole column instead of having to apply for each cell.
- Minimize AutoFit manipulations.
- Get **UsedRange** globally. It is recommended to get the UsedRange in loops as follows.

```csharp
[C#]

for (int i = 0; i < sheet.UsedRange.LastRow; i++)
{
    // Do not use the following method.
    int lastRow = sheet.UsedRange.LastRow;
    for (int i = 0; i < lastRow; i++)
}
```

- Use **IMigrantRange** to optimize memory performance while dealing with large strings.
- Use **global styles**, rather than using different cell styles for each cell/range.
- Use **Begin** and **End** call while using more than one global style for a worksheet.
- Use **Value** and **Value2** property only when the data type is unknown. Value/Value2 property checks the data type of the given string and hence this consumes time.
- Files parsing can be optimized by setting **IApplication.UseFastRecordParsing = false** or **true** (true — fast mode, but less error checks and false — slower but more reliable).
- To extract values little faster, use **Unsafe** code option of **IApplication** interface as follows.

```csharp
[C#]

application.DataProviderType = ExcelDataProviderType.Unsafe;
```

- Make use of **GetText**, **SetText**, **GetNumber**, and **SetNumber** methods that enable users to get/set values without range object.
- Set **IWorkbook.DetectDateTimelnValue** property to **false** with **Value2** property, if you are sure that the given value is not of **DateTime** data type, which improves time performance.
- Use **BeginUpdate** and **EndUpdate** methods for large blocks of Data Validation greatly improves the performance.
- Use **DataProvider.Unsafe** option to increase performance while deleting large numbers of rows or columns.
- Use **CompressionLevel** to reduce the size of the file.

### Key Features Comparison

- **Autofilter, Data validation, Template marker, and Outlines**: These features are consistently supported across `xls`, `xlsx`, and during conversion from `xls` to `xlsx`.
- **Comments**: While fully supported in both `xls` and `xlsx`, the `xlsx` format only supports comments in a partial manner.
- **Freeze pane and split pane**: These features are supported in both file formats and preserved during the conversion process.
- **Macros**: Macros are not supported in `xls` or `xlsx`, but they are preserved if present in the source `xls` file during conversion.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: These features are partially supported, specifically for the default encryption, in both `xls` and `xlsx` formats.

### Implications of Conversion from `xls` to `xlsx`

- **Preservation of features**: The conversion process ensures that most features are preserved, especially those that are commonly used like Autofilter, Data validation, and Freeze pane.
- **Limitations**: Complex features such as Macros are not supported in `xlsx` and are therefore not preserved during conversion.
- **Partial support**: Features like Comments are preserved but in a reduced capacity when converting between the two file formats.

### Notes on Feature Support

- Certain features like Template marker and Outlooks are consistently supported across both file types.
- The `xlsx` format, being newer, generally aligns more closely with modern standards but may not support some legacy features found in `xls`.

## API Reference

This section provides information on the APIs related to handling Excel files in `.xls` and `.xlsx` formats. For detailed API references, refer to the Syncfusion documentation.

### Methods and Properties

- `LoadStream`: Loads an Excel file from a stream into a workbook.
- `Save`: Saves the current workbook to a file or stream.

## Code Examples

### Example: Reading and Writing Excel Files

```csharp
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;
using System.IO;

// Create a new Workbook instance.
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
    IWorkbook workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Create(1);
    IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

    // Write data to the worksheet.
    worksheet.CreateTextRange("A1", "Hello, World!");

    // Save the workbook to a file.
    FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("output.xlsx", FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write);
    workbook.SaveAs(fileStream);
    fileStream.Close();
}

// Reading the workbook.
using (ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
    using (IWorkbook workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("output.xlsx"))
    {
        IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
        string data = worksheet.CreateTextRange("A1").Text;
        Console.WriteLine(data);
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to write to and read from an `.xlsx` file using the `XlsIO` API.

# Essential XlsIO

At times, the text you enter in a cell will be wider than the cell. In such situations, the text may be hidden beyond the edge of the cell. Although one solution to this problem is to resize the cell, there are two additional solutions. They are, to Shrink the text to fit the cell, or Wrap the text so that it is displayed in multiple lines within the cell.

Yet another solution could be to merge multiple cells, so that the text can be fully displayed.

XlsIO allows to set these text control options by using the following APIs.

```csharp
[C#]

// Merging of Cells.
sheet.Range["A16:C16"].Merge();

// Wrapping Text.
sheet.Range["A14"].WrapText = true;
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

' Merging of Cells.
sheet.Range("A16:C16").Merge()

' Wrapping Text.
sheet.Range("A14").WrapText = True
```

## Orientation

The Orientation section enables you to bend the text to a fixed angle. There are two ways to set an angle. By dragging the small red diamond, one can specify the desired angle. You can also click one of the arrows of the Degrees spin button.

```csharp
[C#]

// Text Orientation Settings.
sheet.Range["B2"].CellStyle.Rotation = 60;
sheet.Range["B4"].CellStyle.Rotation = 90;
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

' Text Orientation Settings.
sheet.Range("B2").CellStyle.Rotation = 60;
```

# Formatting in Excel

## Overview

- Excel removes leading zeros in zip codes, but number formats can be used to retain them.
- Custom number formats for zip codes, social security numbers, and telephone numbers are available.
- The table below explains various custom formatting codes for numbers and text.

## Content

### Information About Number Formats

Excel removes the zero (0) in the zip code. The reason is that zero is not required to display the value of the number. However, since number formats are not about the value, but they are about the appearance, you can use a special format to retain the leading zeros, **00000**.

#### Special Number Formats

In addition to the **00000** Zip Code number format, Excel also has:

- **00000-0000** for Zip-Plus-Four
- **000-00-0000** for Social Security numbers
- **(000)000-0000** for telephone numbers

If you live in a location that needs different zip codes, you can either design your own custom number formats.

#### Custom Formatting Codes

The following table shows various custom formatting codes.

| Number Code | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General     | General number format.                                                     |
| 0 (zero)    | Digit placeholder. This code pads the value with zeros to fill the format. |
| #           | Digit placeholder. This code does not display extra zeros.                 |
| ?           | Digit placeholder. This code leaves a space for insignificant zeros but does not display them. |
| . (period)  | Decimal number.                                                           |
| %          | Percentage. Microsoft Excel multiplies by 100 and adds the % character.    |
| , (comma)   | Thousands separator. A comma followed by a placeholder scales the number by a thousand. |
| E+ E- e+ e- | Scientific notation.                                                      |

#### Text Codes

| Text Code          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $ - + / () : space | These characters are displayed in the number. To display any other character, enclose the character in quotation marks or precede it with a backslash. |
| \character         | This code displays the character you specify. Note Typing !, ^, &, ', ~, {, }, =, <, or > automatically places a backslash in front of the character. |

### Notes

- Excel's number formatting is about appearance, not value.
- You can design custom number formats for special requirements.

### Color Pallet

Excel supports colors for fonts and background fills through what is called the **Color Pallet**. The Pallet is an array or series of 56 RGB colors. The value of each of those 56 colors may be any of the 16 million available colors, but the Pallet, and thus the number of distinct colors in a workbook, is limited to 56 colors. The RGB values in the Pallet are accessed by the **ColorIndex** property. The ColorIndex is an offset or index in the Pallet, and thus has a value between 1 and 56. In the default, unmodified Pallet, the 3rd element in the Pallet is the RGB value 255 (&HFF), which is red.

When you format a cell's background to red, for example, you are actually assigning to the **ColorIndex** property of the Interior a value of 3. Excel reads the 3 in the ColorIndex property, and goes to the 3rd element of the Pallet to get the actual RGB color. If you modify the Pallet, say by changing the 3rd element from red (255 = &HFF) to blue (16,711,680 = &HFF0000), all items that were once red are changed to blue. This is because the value of the 3rd element in the Pallet has been changed from red to blue, while the ColorIndex property remains equal to 3.

You can change the values in the default pallet by modifying the **Colors** array of the workbook. You can also get the colors in the palette by using the **Palette** property.

### Colors in XlsIO

XlsIO provides support for adding new colors to the color palette that are not available in the standard MS Excel color palette, by using the **SetPaletteColor** method. If you have modified as workbook's Pallet, you can reset the pallet back to the default values, by using the **ResetPalette** method.

The following code example illustrates how to set the color palette.

```csharp
// Creating color palette.
string[] known = Enum.GetNames(
    typeof(KnownColor)
);
Color[] palette = workbook.Palette;

for (int i = (int)ExcelKnownColors.Custom0; i < palette.Length; i++)
{
    KnownColor value = (KnownColor)Enum.Parse(
      typeof(KnownColor),
      known[i]
    );
    workbook.SetPaletteColor(
      i, Color.FromKnownColor(value)
    );
}

palette = workbook.Palette;
```

## XlsIO: Applying Global Styles

### Overview
- Demonstrates how to apply global styles to an Excel worksheet using XlsIO.
- Highlights the use of body and header styles with thin borders and a defined color palette.

### Content

#### Setting Global Styles

Below is the code snippet demonstrating how to apply global styles to an Excel worksheet:

```csharp
workbook.SetPaletteColor(9, Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247));
bodyStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247);
bodyStyle.Borders(ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeLeft).LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
bodyStyle.Borders(ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeRight).LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
bodyStyle.EndUpdate();

' Apply the defined styles.
' Apply Body Style.
sheet.UsedRange.CellStyleName = "BodyStyle"

' Apply Header style.
sheet.Rows[0].CellStyleName = "HeaderStyle"
```

#### Explanation of Code
- `workbook.SetPaletteColor(9, Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247))`: Sets the color palette for the workbook.
- `bodyStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(239, 243, 247)`: Applies a specific color to the body style.
- `bodyStyle.Borders(ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeLeft).LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin`: Configures thin borders for the left edge of the body style.
- `bodyStyle.Borders(ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeRight).LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin`: Configures thin borders for the right edge of the body style.
- `bodyStyle.EndUpdate()`: Completes the update of the body style.
- `sheet.UsedRange.CellStyleName = "BodyStyle"`: Applies the defined body style to the entire used range of the sheet.
- `sheet.Rows[0].CellStyleName = "HeaderStyle"`: Applies a header style to the first row of the sheet.

# Essential XlsIO

## Content

### 4.1.3.3 Formats

**Overview**
- This section explains various formatting features in Excel cells using simple APIs provided by XlsIO. It covers cell resizing, visibility control, sheet organization, and cell protection.

**Details**
Excel cells have various formats that can be applied to customize the cells as per the users' needs. These formats include sizing up of the cell, showing or hiding cells, protecting the cells, and organizing the sheet that contains the cell.

XlsIO provides support for such formatting with simple APIs. This section explains the support for the following formats:

- **Cell Size** - This section explains various methods that are used to resize cells.
- **Visibility** - This section explains various options that control the cell's visibility.
- **Sheet Organization** - This section explains various manipulations for sheets that contain cells.
- **Protection** - This section explains how a cell and sheet can be protected from editing.

### 4.1.3.3.1 Changing Cell Size

## API Reference

### C#
```csharp
// Deleting Rows.
sheet.DeleteRow(startRow, NoOfRows);

// Deleting Columns.
sheet.DeleteColumn(startColumn, NoOfColumn);
```

### VB.NET
```vb
' Deleting Rows.
sheet.DeleteRow(startRow, NoOfRows)

' Deleting Columns.
sheet.DeleteColumn(startColumn, NoOfColumn)
```

**Notes:**
- **Efficiency Note**: Deletion by using the above methods is more efficient than looping.
- **Indexing Note**: Row/Column index of these methods are "one based".

## Code Examples

### C#
```csharp
// Example of deleting rows and columns
sheet.DeleteRow(2, 5); // Deletes 5 rows starting from row 2
sheet.DeleteColumn(3, 2); // Deletes 2 columns starting from column 3
```

### VB.NET
```vb
' Example of deleting rows and columns
sheet.DeleteRow(2, 5) ' Deletes 5 rows starting from row 2
sheet.DeleteColumn(3, 2) ' Deletes 2 columns starting from column 3
```

## Autofit and Cell Visibility in XlsIO

### Overview
- Discusses how the `AutoFit` functionality works in XlsIO, particularly with respect to cell text and row height.
- Highlights specific conditions under which `AutoFit` is not applied, such as cells with text wrapping or merged cells.
- Explains methods to manage cell visibility, including hiding and unhiding rows and columns using commands and properties.

### Content

#### Autofit Usage in XlsIO

Here, though the cell "B2" has long text, `AutoFit` will not be applied to this column as the cell inside the range [5, 2, 19, 2] has text smaller than that. Similarly, the row height for Row 15 will not be affected with `AutoFit` rows, as the range [5, 2, 13, 4] has a row height smaller than Row 15.

**Note:**
1. If a `Range` text is text wrapped, `AutoFitColumn` method will not be applied on it.
2. If a `Range` is merged, `AutoFit` methods will not be applied on it. Note that this is the behavior of MS Word.
3. Implementation of `AutoFit` methods are more time-consuming. Use these methods in minimal for better performance.

#### 4.1.3.3.2 Cell Visibility

- **Controlling Cell Visibility:** One of the most useful features in MS Excel is the ability to show/hide rows and columns according to the user's needs, producing readable content in large data worksheets.
  
  Following section explains the support provided by XlsIO to hide/unhide sheets and rows/columns.

##### 4.1.3.3.2.1 Hide/Unhide Rows and Columns

Excel allows to hide a row/column by using the `Hide` command, but a row or column also becomes hidden when you change its row height or column width to zero. Also, you can show a hidden row/column by using the `Unhide` command.

## Overview

- Demonstrates how to hide a worksheet using the `Visibility` property.
- Explains hiding all tabs in a workbook using the `DisplayWorkbookTabs` option.
- Highlights the ability to activate a specific worksheet on opening using the `Activate` method.

## Content

### Hiding Worksheets

To hide a specific worksheet, you can use the `Visibility` property as shown below:

```csharp
sheet.Visibility = WorksheetVisibility.Hidden;
```

This code snippet hides the specified worksheet. The effect is illustrated in **Figure 68: Hidden Worksheet**.

![Figure 68: Hidden Worksheet](Sheet2Hidden.png)

### Hiding All Tabs

You can also hide all tabs in the worksheet by using the `DisplayWorkbookTabs` option in the `IWorkbook` interface. This feature is particularly useful for managing large workbooks where you want to minimize visual clutter and improve navigation.

### Activating a Worksheet

XlsIO provides an option to activate a worksheet while opening it in the workbook, equivalent to clicking on a worksheet in MS Excel. This is achieved using the `Activate` method:

#### C#

```csharp
sheet.Activate();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
sheet.Activate()
```

When the workbook is opened, the specified worksheet will be the active one, simplifying user interaction.

## API Reference

### Methods and Properties

- **Visibility Property**
  - Type: `WorksheetVisibility`
  - Possible values: `Hidden`, `Visible`
  - Use to set the visibility state of a worksheet.

- **Activate Method**
  - Activates the specified worksheet upon opening the workbook.

## Code Examples

### Hiding a Worksheet

#### C#

```csharp
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets["Sheet2"];
sheet.Visibility = WorksheetVisibility.Hidden;
```

### Activating a Worksheet

#### C#

```csharp
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets["Sheet1"];
sheet.Activate();
```

chart.Legend.Layout.TopMode = LayoutModes.edge;
chart.Legend.Layout.Left = 400;
chart.Legend.Layout.Top = 150;
chart.Legend.Layout.Width = 50;
chart.Legend.Layout.Height = 100;

// Saving workbook
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007;
string fileName = @"../../Output/SampleOutput.xlsx";
workbook.SaveAs(fileName);
workbook.Close();
excelEngine.Dispose();
```

### Code Example: VB

```vb
' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine

' Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("../../Data/Sample.xlsx", ExcelOpenType.Automatic)
Dim worksheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)
Dim chart As IChart = worksheet.Charts(0)

' Manually positioning chart title
//Edge: Specifies that the Width or Height will be interpreted as the right
//or bottom of the chart element
//Factor: Specifies that the Width or Height will be interpreted as the
//width or height of the chart element

chart.PlotArea.Layout.LeftMode = LayoutModes.edge
chart.PlotArea.Layout.TopMode = LayoutModes.edge

'Value in points should not be negative value if LayoutMode is Edge
'//It can be a negative value if LayoutMode is Factor.
```

## Working with Pivot Table Cache

### Overview
- This section describes the process of creating and configuring a pivot table with data sourced from a pivot cache in a spreadsheet using Syncfusion XlsIO.

### Content

#### Creating a Pivot Table Using a Pivot Cache

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create a pivot table in an Excel spreadsheet by adding a pivot cache and configuring its fields.

```csharp
//Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
//Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Set the default version as Excel 2010.
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("PivotCodeDate.xlsx");

// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Access the worksheet to draw pivot table.
IWorksheet pivotSheet = workbook.Worksheets[1];

//Select the data to add in cache.
IPivotCache cache = workbook.PivotCaches.Add(worksheet["A1:H50"]);

//Insert the pivot table.
IPivotTable pivotTable = pivotSheet.PivotTables.Add("PivotTable1", pivotSheet["A1"], cache);
pivotTable.Fields[4].Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Page;

pivotTable.Fields[2].Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Row;
pivotTable.Fields[6].Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Row;
pivotTable.Fields[3].Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Column;

IPivotField field = pivotSheet.PivotTables[0].Fields[5];
pivotTable.DataFields.Add(field, "Sum of Units", PivotSubtotalTypes.Sum);

//Apply row field filter.
IPivotField rowField = pivotTable.Fields[2];
// Applying Label based row field filter
```

#### Explanation of Code

1. **Instantiating the Spreadsheet Engine**:
   - The `ExcelEngine` class is used to create an instance of the spreadsheet creation engine.
   - The `Excel` property of `ExcelEngine` provides an instance of the Excel application object.

2. **Setting the Default Version**:
   - The `DefaultVersion` property of the `IApplication` object is set to `ExcelVersion.Excel2010` to specify that the application will use the Excel 2010 format.

3. **Opening an Existing Workbook**:
   - The `Open` method is used to open the workbook named `PivotCodeDate.xlsx` for further processing.

4. **Accessing Worksheets**:
   - The first worksheet in the workbook is accessed using `workbook.Worksheets[0]`.
   - A second worksheet is accessed for drawing the pivot table using `workbook.Worksheets[1]`.

5. **Adding a Pivot Cache**:
   - The `PivotCaches.Add` method is used to create a pivot cache based on the data in the range `A1:H50` of the source worksheet.

6. **Creating the Pivot Table**:
   - The `PivotTables.Add` method is used to create a new pivot table named `PivotTable1` starting at cell `A1` on the pivot sheet.
   - The pivot table is associated with the previously created pivot cache.

7. **Configuring Pivot Table Fields**:
   - The `Fields` property of the pivot table is used to configure the axes for the pivot table:
     - Fields are assigned to the `Page`, `Row`, and `Column` axes of the pivot table.

8. **Adding Data Fields**:
   - A data field named "Sum of Units" is added to the pivot table using the `DataFields.Add` method.
   - The subtotal type for this data field is set to `PivotSubtotalTypes.Sum`.

9. **Applying Row Field Filter**:
   - A filter is applied to the row field to refine the data displayed in the pivot table based on specific labels.

This example demonstrates the complete process of creating and configuring a pivot table using pivot cache to manage and display data effectively.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- XlsIO supports OLE objects with two types of associations: linked and embedded types.
- Demonstrates linking an OLE object to an Excel document.

## Content

### OLE Objects and Linking Types

XlsIO supports two types of association of objects:
- Objects can be linked to the program
- Objects can be embedded in the program

#### 1. Linked Objects

Linked objects remain as separate files. The linked object would expect the object to be in the same location as created, when the file is opened in another machine.

#### Linking an OLE Object to an Excel document

The following sample code illustrates how to link an OLE Object to an Excel document.

```csharp
[C#]

Image image = Image.FromFile(@"..\..\image.png");

// Select the object to insert, image for the display icon and the type of
// the OLEObject field.
IOleObject ole2 = sheet.OleObjects.Add(@"..\..\Document.docx", image, OleLinkType.Link);

// Set the location
ole2.Location = sheet[5, 12];

// Set the size
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Explanation of Excel's Data Tables feature and its functionalities.
- Overview of "Automatic except Tables" calculation mode.
- Brief introduction to XlsIO's support for calculation modes.
- Information on how to set the calculation mode using code examples.

## Content

### Automatic Except Tables
Excel's Data Tables feature is designed to perform multiple calculations of the workbook, each driven by different values in the table. So using "Automatic except Tables" will stop Excel from automatically triggering multiple calculations at each calculation, but will still calculate all dependent formulae, except tables.

XlsIO provides support for all the above modes of calculation. Following code example illustrates how to set the calculation mode.

```csharp
[IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create();
workbook.CalculationOptions.CalculationMode = ExcelCalculationMode.Manual;
```
```vbnet
Dim workbook as IWorkbook
workbook = application.Workbooks.Create()
workbook.CalculationOptions.CalculationMode = ExcelCalculationMode.Manual
```

There are other options that Excel provides to customize the calculation further.

#### Recalculate Before Save
In Manual mode, this option controls whether Excel will recalculate the workbook as part of the Save process. The default value is set to `True`. You can control this through XlsIO by using the `RecalcOnSave` property of the `ICalculationOptions` interface.

#### Iteration
If you have intentional circular references in your workbook, these settings allow you to control the maximum number of times the workbook will be recalculated (iterations), and the convergence criteria (maximum change: when to stop). The default value should be set to `False`, so that Excel does not try to solve accidental circular references. XlsIO allows to control these iterations as follows.

```csharp
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create();
```

### Defining Business Objects with Marker Attributes

The following C# code defines a `Sales` class with properties for managing sales data. These properties are marked with attributes to specify formatting and display information.

```csharp
[C#]
//Definition of the business objects with the marker argument
class Sales
{
    private string m_salesPerson;
    private int m_sold;

    [TemplateMarkerAttributes("Sales Person Name")]
    public string SalesPerson
    {
        get
        {
            return m_salesPerson;
        }
        set
        {
            m_salesPerson = value;
        }
    }

    [TemplateMarkerAttributes("Sold", "$#,###")]
    public int Sold
    {
        get
        {
            return m_sold;
        }
        set
        {
            m_sold = value;
        }
    }

    public Sales()
    {
    }

    public Sales(string name, int sold)
    {
        this.m_salesPerson = name;
        this.m_sold = sold;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Properties**:
   - **SalesPerson**: Represents the name of the salesperson, marked with the attribute `"Sales Person Name"`.
   - **Sold**: Represents the number of units sold, marked with the attribute `"Sold", "$#,###"` to format the output as a numeric value with thousands separators.

2. **Constructors**:
   - A default constructor is provided for flexibility.
   - A parameterized constructor is included to initialize the `Sales` class with a salesperson's name and the number of units sold.

3. **TemplateMarkerAttributes**:
   - These attributes are used to specify how the properties will be displayed or formatted in the application.

## API Reference

### Namespace and Class

```csharp
namespace YourNamespace
{
    class Sales
    {
        // Properties and methods as described above
    }
}
```

### Properties

- **SalesPerson**:
  - **Type**: `string`
  - **Attribute**: `[TemplateMarkerAttributes("Sales Person Name")]`
  - **Description**: Holds the name of the salesperson.

- **Sold**:
  - **Type**: `int`
  - **Attribute**: `[TemplateMarkerAttributes("Sold", "$#,###")]`
  - **Description**: Holds the number of units sold, formatted with thousands separators.

### Constructors

- **Sales()**
  - **Description**: Default constructor for the `Sales` class.
  
- **Sales(string name, int sold)**
  - **Parameters**:
    - `name`: The name of the salesperson.
    - `sold`: The number of units sold.
  - **Description**: Parameterized constructor to initialize the `Sales` object with specific values.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Sales Object

```csharp
Sales sale = new Sales("John Doe", 5000);
Console.WriteLine($"Salesperson: {sale.SalesPerson}, Sold: {sale.Sold}");
```

### Example 2: Using TemplateMarkerAttributes

```csharp
// Assume a template is configured to use these marker attributes
// The attributes will be used to format and display the sales data in the desired style.
```

## Conclusion

This example illustrates how to define a `Sales` class with marked attributes in C#. These attributes are crucial for integrating the class with templates or other formatting mechanisms, ensuring consistent and well-presented data output.

```csharp
// Insert Array Horizontally.
string[] names = new string[] { "Mickey", "Donald", "Tom", "Jerry" };
string[] descriptions = new string[] { "Mouse", "Duck", "Cat", "Mouse" };
marker.AddVariable("Names", names);
marker.AddVariable("Descriptions", descriptions);

// Stretch Formula
marker.AddVariable("NumbersTable", numbersDt);

// Process the markers in the template.
marker.ApplyMarkers();
```

### VB.NET Code: Creating Template Marker Processor

```vb
' Create Template Marker Processor.
' Northwind Customers Table
Dim marker As ITemplateMarkersProcessor = workbook.CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor()
marker.AddVariable("Customers", northwindDt)

' Insert Array Horizontally.
Dim names As String() = New String() {"Mickey", "Donald", "Tom", "Jerry"}
Dim descriptions As String() = New String() {"Mouse", "Duck", "Cat", "Mouse"}
marker.AddVariable("Names", names)
marker.AddVariable("Descriptions", descriptions)

' Stretch Formula
marker.AddVariable("NumbersTable", numbersDt)

' Process the markers in the template.
marker.ApplyMarkers()
```

## Essential XlsIO

### Scroll Bar

You may allow the users to view a particular worksheet, but hide the content in the last part of the worksheet from them. This can be done by hiding the scrollbars, by turning off either scrollbar checkbox, in the View tab of the Options dialog box.

XlsIO allows to control the visibility of these horizontal and vertical scrollbars in a workbook by using the IsHScrollBarVisible and IsVScrollBarVisible properties of IWorkbook as follows.

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Hides Horizontal scroll bar and show the vertical scroll bar
workbook.IsHScrollBarVisible = false;
workbook.IsVScrollBarVisible = true;
```

```vb
' Hides Horizontal scroll bar and show the vertical scroll bar
workbook.IsHScrollBarVisible = False
workbook.IsVScrollBarVisible = True
```

### Sheet Tabs

Excel allows to show/hide the workbook tabs, to prevent users from switching between sheets through sheet tabs, and focus their attention on a particular sheet.
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- [C#] and [VB.NET] code snippets for encrypting and decrypting Excel workbooks.
- Instructions for setting passwords for opening, modifying, and read-only access to Excel workbooks.
- Information about the encryption type supported by Essential XlsIO and its limitations regarding weak and strong encryption.

## Content

### Encryption and Decryption Code Examples

#### [C#]

```csharp
// Encryption:
// Encrypt the workbook with password.
workbook.PasswordToOpen = "syncfusion";

// Set the password to modify the workbook.
workbook.SetWriteProtectionPassword("modify");

// Set the workbook as read-only.
workbook.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;

// Decryption:
// Opening the encrypted workbook.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("FileName.xls",
ExcelParseOptions.Default, true, "syncfusion");
```

#### [VB.NET]

```vbnet
' Encryption:
' Encrypt the workbook with password.
workbook.PasswordToOpen = "syncfusion"

' Set the password to modify the workbook.
workbook.SetWriteProtectionPassword("modify")

' Set the workbook as read-only.
workbook.ReadOnlyRecommended= true

' Decryption:
' Opening the encrypted workbook.
Dim workbook As Syncfusion.XlsIO.IWorkbook = 
Application.Workbooks.Open("FileName.xls", ExcelParseOptions.Default, True, "syncfusion")
```

### Note

**Note:** Essential XlsIO supports default encryption of the type "Office97-2000 compatible", and does not support weak and strong encryption types.

### Decryption

**Decryption** is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form, so that the data can be read from the workbook. You can decrypt the workbook with the encrypted password. Note that XlsIO cannot open workbooks without knowing the password.

## API Reference

### Methods and Properties
- `PasswordToOpen`: Sets the password required to open the workbook.
- `SetWriteProtectionPassword`: Sets the password required to modify the workbook.
- `ReadOnlyRecommended`: Sets the workbook as read-only.

### Parameters
- `FileName`: The file name of the Excel workbook.
- `Password`: The password to decrypt the Excel workbook.

### Returns
- An `IWorkbook` object representing the decrypted Excel workbook.

### Exceptions
- Throws an exception if the password is incorrect.

## Code Examples

### C# Example

```csharp
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize Excel Engine

### Registering and Using Add-Ins in XlsIO

#### Introduction
XlsIO provides support for Excel and custom Add-Ins. They can be accessed by first registering, and then using the Add-In's custom functions through XlsIO formulas.

#### Figure References
- **Figure 161: Add-Ins**
  - Displays the Add-Ins dialog in Excel, showing available add-ins like Analysis ToolPak, Bloomberg Excel Tools, Blip, and others.
- **Figure 162: Add-Ins in Excel**
  - Shows the Excel ribbon with the Add-Ins tab active, highlighting tools like Function Builder, Formula Conversion Tool, Real-Time Updates, and more.

#### Example Code for Registering and Using Add-Ins

[C#]
```csharp
IAddInFunctions unknownFunctions = workbook.AddInFunctions;
unknownFunctions.Add("c:\\blp\\api\\dde\\blp.xla", "blp");

// Use the Function.
sheet.Range[ "A3" ].Formula = "blp(A1+\" CORP\",\"PX_LAST\")";
```

### Explanation of Code Example
- `IAddInFunctions unknownFunctions = workbook.AddInFunctions;`: Initializes an object to handle Add-In functions.
- `unknownFunctions.Add("c:\\blp\\api\\dde\\blp.xla", "blp");`: Registers the Bloomberg add-in (blp) from the specified location.
- `sheet.Range[ "A3" ].Formula = "blp(A1+\" CORP\",\"PX_LAST\")";`: Sets a formula in cell A3 that uses the registered Bloomberg function to retrieve the last price for a specified corporation.

source.CopyTo(des)
```

## 5.1.4 How to ignore the green error marker in worksheets?

You can ignore the error marker that appears in cells, when there exists data that are of different formats. This can be done by using the ExcelIgnoreError enumerator that provides various options to ignore the error marker.

### C#

```csharp
// Ignore Error Options.
sheet.Range["B3"].IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.All;
```

### VB.NET

```vb
' Ignore Error Options.
sheet.Range("B3").IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.All
```

```

### 5.1.10 How to set a line break inside a cell?

In order to set a line break inside a cell, you have to enable Text Wrapping for the cell, and then break the text. The following code example illustrates how to do this.

#### C#

```csharp
sheet.Range["A1"].CellStyle.WrapText = true;
sheet.Range["A1"].Text = String.Format("Hello\nworld");
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
sheet.Range("A1").CellStyle.WrapText = True
sheet.Range("A1").Text = String.Format("Hello" & Constants.vbLf & "world")
```

### 5.1.11 How to set or format a Header/Footer?

The string that the header/footer takes is a script that you can use to format the header/footer. For more information on formatting the string, see [http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=213618](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=213618).

#### C#

```csharp
mySheet.PageSetup.CenterHeader = @"&""Gothic,bold""Center Header Text";
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
mySheet.PageSetup.CenterHeader = @"&""Gothic,bold""Center Header Text"

## Opening Excel Template Files

An Excel Template file is opened in the same way a document is opened. The following code example illustrates how to open a template file.

```csharp
[C#]
workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileName, ExcelOpenType.Automatic);
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(fileName, ExcelOpenType.Automatic)
```

### 5.1.17 How to open an Excel 2007 Macro Enabled Template?

XlsIO now provides support to open and save an Excel 2007 Macro Enabled Template to XLSM (Excel 2007 Macro Enabled Document) format. The following code example illustrates this.

```csharp
[C#]
// Open an existing XLTM file.
Workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(@"Template.xltm", ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

// Save the file as XLSM.
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007;
```

```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- This page demonstrates the use of marker syntax to bind data in Excel files.
- It shows an example where data is bound to a marker that retains the formula for calculating product prices.

## Content

### Excel Data Binding Example

The following image (Figure 166) illustrates a screenshot of an Excel file after the data has been bound to a marker that retains the formula:

**Figure 166: Marker Syntax**

Here is a screen shot after binding the data with the marker that retains the formula.

| **Product ID** | **Quantity** | **Unit Price** | **Price** |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| 4               | 8            | 6              | 48        |
| 5               | 9            | 8              | 72        |
| 3               | 4            | 2              | 8         |
| 3               | 2            | 5              | 10        |
| 8               | 2            | 2              | 4         |
| 1               | 9            | 7              | 63        |
| 5               | 6            | 3              | 18        |
| 7               | 9            | 9              | 81        |
| 0               | 2            | 1              | 2         |
| 9               | 8            | 7              | 56        |

The data shown above is structured as follows:
- **Product ID**: Identifies each product.
- **Quantity**: The number of units purchased.
- **Unit Price**: The price per unit for each product.
- **Price**: The total price for each product, calculated using the formula.

This example demonstrates how the marker in the Excel file retains the formula for calculating the total price to display accurate and dynamic results.

## 5.2.5 How to zip files using the Syncfusion.Compression.Zip namespace?

You can use the AddFile method of ZipArchive object to compress files by using XlsIO. Following code example illustrates how to use this method.

```csharp
// Suppress the summary rows at the bottom.
sheet.PageSetup.IsSummaryRowBelow = False
// Suppress the summary columns to the right.
sheet.PageSetup.IsSummaryColumnRight = False
```

### Code Example

**[C#]**

```csharp
Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive zipArchive = new Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive();
zipArchive.DefaultCompressionLevel = Syncfusion.Compression.CompressionLevel.Best;

// Add the file you want to zip.
zipArchive.AddFile("..\\..Form1.cs");

// Zip file name and location.
zipArchive.Save("SyncfusionCompressFileSample.zip");
zipArchive.Close();
```

**[VB.NET]**

```vb
Dim zipArchive As New Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive()
zipArchive.DefaultCompressionLevel = Syncfusion.Compression.CompressionLevel.Best

' Add the file you want to zip.
zipArchive.AddFile("..\\..Form1.cs")

' Zip file name and location.
zipArchive.Save("SyncfusionCompressFileSample.zip")
zipArchive.Close()
```

For detailed API information, refer to the Syncfusion documentation for XlsIO.

## Code Examples

```csharp
// Example of using XlsIO to create and save an Excel file
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;

// Create a new workbook
IWorkbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Open the workbook in Excel file format
workbook.Open("Sample.xlsx");

// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Set the value of a cell
worksheet.Cells[0, 0].Value = "Hello, World!";

// Save the workbook
workbook.Save("Output.xlsx");

// Close the workbook
workbook.Close();
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- This page describes how to save workbooks using Essential XlsIO in Windows Forms, Web Forms, and WPF applications.
- Covers saving files to different formats and implementing the `SaveAs` method for disk and stream support.
- Provides sample code for saving workbooks to disk and streaming them to the client browser in both Windows (C# and VB.NET) and Web applications.

## Content

### 3.7 Saving a Workbook
Essential XlsIO is a Non-UI component that can be used on Windows Forms, Web Forms, and WPF applications.

Any changes made in a new or existing worksheet will be affected only if the workbook is saved to a disk or a stream. XlsIO supports saving files to different formats in stream and disk by using the `SaveAs` method of `IWorkbook`. The workbook can be saved to stream/disk/response. The only code that is specific for the usage of XlsIO in a Windows Forms application and WPF application is the saving of the spreadsheet to disk, and for Web Forms applications, it is the streaming of the spreadsheet to the client browser.

#### The following is the code sample to save the document to disk:

#### Saving Worksheet in Windows and WPF Applications

```csharp
[C#]
// Saving the workbook to disk.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xls");
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
'Saving the workbook to disk.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xls");
```

#### Saving Worksheet in Web Applications

```csharp
[C#]
// Stream the workbook to the client browser.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xls", ExcelSaveType.SaveAsXLS, Response, ExcelDownloadType.Open);
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]
'Stream the workbook to the client browser.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xls", ExcelSaveType.SaveAsXLS, Response, ExcelDownloadType.Open)
```

#### Similarly, you can open an xlsx file inside the browser by using the following code sample.
```markdown

## Code Examples

#### Using C#

```csharp
// Open an existing spreadsheet which will be used as a template for
// generating the new spreadsheet.
// After opening the spreadsheet, the workbook object represents the
// complete in-memory object model of the template spreadsheet.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("SpreadsheetFromTemplate.xls");

// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Inserting some additional data.
sheet.Range["A1"].Text = "New text that was not present in the template";

// Saving the workbook to disk. This spreadsheet is the result of opening
// an existing spreadsheet and then saving the result to a new workbook.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xls");

// Close the workbook.
Workbook.Close();

// Dispose the Excel engine
excelEngine.Dispose();
```

#### Using VB.NET

```vb
' New instance of XlsIO is created.[Equivalent to launching MS Excel with no
' workbooks open].
' The instantiation process consists of two steps.

' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()

' Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel

' Open an existing spreadsheet which, will be used as a template for
' generating the new spreadsheet.
' After opening the spreadsheet, the workbook object represents the complete
' in-memory object model of the template spreadsheet.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open(".....\Data\SpreadsheetFromTemplate.xls")

' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

## Content

### Number Code
| Number Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| "text"      | This code displays the text.                                       |
| *           | This code repeats the next character in the format to fill the column width. <br> Note: Only one asterisk per section of a format is allowed.                                       |
| _ (underscore) | This code skips the width of the next character. This code is commonly used as "_)" (without the quotation marks) to leave space for a closing parenthesis in a positive number format when the negative number format includes parentheses. <br> This allows the values to line up at the decimal point. |
| @           | Text placeholder.                                                   |

| mmm       | Month as an abbreviation (Jan - Dec).           |
| mmmm      | Unabbreviated Month (January - December).       |
| d         | Day without leading zeros (1-31).               |
| dd        | Day with leading zeros (01-31).                 |
| ddd       | Week day as an abbreviation (Sun - Sat).        |
| dddd      | Unabbreviated week day (Sunday - Saturday).     |

## Essential XlsIO

### Setting Number Format

The following example demonstrates how to set a custom number format using the `NumberFormat` property:

```csharp
sheet.Range("C4").NumberFormat = "$#,##0.00";
```

**Note:** You can also set custom formats such as Accounting by using the `NumberFormat` property as shown in the preceding code example.

### Entering Data in Text Format

The following code example illustrates entering data in the `Text` format.

#### C#

```csharp
sheet.Range["C4"].Text = "1.20";
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
sheet.Range("C4").Text = "1.20"
```

### Getting and Setting Data in Cells

XlsIO provides the following properties to get/set the data in the cells:

- **DisplayText**: Gets the text that is displayed in the cell. This is a read-only property, which returns a cell value that is displayed after the number format application.

- **Value**: Gets/sets the string from it. Since the user can assign different data types, the `Value` property parses the input string to determine which type was used. It sequentially checks whether it is an empty cell, formula, boolean, error, number, or date-time.

- **Value2**: This object returns/sets the cell value. It works in the following way: it first checks whether the specified object has the type known for it (DateTime, TimeSpan, Double, Int). If yes, then it uses the corresponding typed properties (DateTime, TimeSpan, Number). Otherwise, it calls the `Value` property with String data type.

#### Difference Between `Value2` and `Value`

The only difference between the `Value2` property and the `Value` property is that the `Value2` property does not use the Currency and Date data types. Additionally, it does not support `FormulaArray` values.

### Using `IsStringsPreserved` Property

The `IsStringsPreserved` property of `IWorksheet` is used to modify its behavior and return `bool`, `double`, or `datetime`. Otherwise, it returns the `Value` property.

### Working with Color Palette in Excel

The following examples show how to interact with the color palette in Excel using the XlsIO library.

#### C#

```csharp
int pos = 0;
for (int j = 1; j < 100; j++)
{
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        ExcelKnownColors knownEnm = (ExcelKnownColors)pos;
        sheet.Range[j, i].CellStyle.ColorIndex = knownEnm;
        sheet.Range[j, i].Text = palette[pos].Name + ", " +
            string.Format("R{0}:G{1}:B{2}:A{3}", palette[pos].R,
            palette[pos].G, palette[pos].B, palette[pos].A);
        pos++;
        
        if (pos >= palette.Length) break;
    }
    if (pos >= palette.Length) break;
}
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' Creating color palette.
Dim known As String() = System.Enum.GetNames(GetType(KnownColor))
Dim palette As Color() = workbook.Palette

Dim i As Integer = CInt(ExcelKnownColors.Custom0)

Do While i < palette.Length
    Dim value As KnownColor = CType(System.Enum.Parse(GetType(KnownColor), known(i)), KnownColor)
    workbook.SetPaletteColor(i, Color.FromKnownColor(value))
    i += 1
Loop

palette = workbook.Palette
Dim pos As Integer = 0
For j As Integer = 1 To 99
    For i = 1 To 3
        Dim knownEnm As ExcelKnownColors = CType(pos, ExcelKnownColors)
        sheet.Range(j, i).CellStyle.ColorIndex = knownEnm
        sheet.Range(j, i).Text = palette(pos).Name & ", " &
        String.Format("R{0}:G{1}:B{2}:A{3}", palette(pos).R, palette(pos).G, palette(pos).B, palette(pos).A)
        pos += 1
        
        If pos >= palette.Length Then
            ' Break out of inner loop if necessary.
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
    If pos >= palette.Length Then
        ' Break out of outer loop if necessary.
        Exit For
    End If
Next
```

### Explanation

- **C# Example**:
  - Initializes a `pos` variable to track the current color in the palette.
  - Iterates through rows and columns (limited to three columns per row) using nested `for` loops.
  - Sets the `ColorIndex` of each cell to the corresponding Excel color and displays its name and RGB properties.
  - Breaks out of the loops when all colors in the palette have been processed.

- **VB.NET Example**:
  - Creates a `palette` using the workbook's available colors.
  - Uses a `Do While` loop to populate the `palette` with predefined colors.
  - Iterates through rows and columns, setting the `ColorIndex` of each cell and displaying the color details.
  - Uses `Exit For` to handle the case when all palette colors have been processed.

### Key Points
- Both examples effectively demonstrate how to populate an Excel sheet with color styles and display color information.
- The use of `KnownColors` and `ColorIndex` helps in associating named colors with Excel cells.
- The structured approach ensures that all available colors in the predefined palette are utilized efficiently.

## API Reference

### Methods Used
- `System.Enum.GetNames`: Retrieves the names of the constants in an enumeration.

## Essential XlsIO

### Applying Default style in XlsIO

XlsIO provides various ways to apply styles. The `IStyle` interface is used for creating styles. You can set the default styles created with groups of styles to a range of rows and columns. This is the most optimized approach to format rows and columns with large numbers of cells with the same styles.

Following code example illustrates how to create and apply default styles for a range of rows and columns.

#### C#

```csharp
// Define the default styles that need to be applied to rows and columns.
IStyle rowStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("RowStyle");
rowStyle.Color = Color.LightCoral;
IStyle columnStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("ColumnStyle");
columnStyle.Color = Color.Orange;

// Set Column Default Style
sheet.SetDefaultRowStyle(1, 2, rowStyle);

// Set Column Default Style
sheet.SetDefaultColumnStyle(1, 2, columnStyle);
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
' Define the default styles that need to be applied to rows and columns
Dim rowStyle As IStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("RowStyle")
rowStyle.Color = Color.LightCoral
Dim columnStyle As IStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("ColumnStyle")
columnStyle.Color = Color.Orange

' Set Column Default Style
sheet.SetDefaultRowStyle(1, 2, rowStyle)

' Set Column Default Style
sheet.SetDefaultColumnStyle(1, 2, columnStyle)
```

---

**Note**: Applying custom styles will override the original styles.

### Conditional Formatting

#### Overview
- Conditional formatting dynamically formats cell contents based on values.
- Allows defining and applying formatting to cells, text, and numbers based on specific criteria.
- Useful for highlighting overtime in time sheets or tracking top sales employees based on quotas.

#### Content

Conditional formatting is a feature by which the contents of a cell are dynamically formatted, based on a value. It allows you to define and apply formatting to some cells, text, and numbers, based on the criteria that is set. For example, you can format a time sheet, to point out the overtime obtained by the employee. You can also use it to track the best sales employees in a company, by setting a quota that makes a cell range particular.

In MS Excel, click the **Format** menu and then click **Conditional Formatting**. You can use any criteria of your choice. The formatting can be applied to cells' values or a particular formula.

##### Figure 46: Conditional Formatting option displayed in Format Menu

##### Figure 47: Using Conditional Formatting Feature in MS Excel
![Figure 47: Using Conditional Formatting Feature in MS Excel](https://.../image_url_for_Figure_47)

#### Notes
- Excel allows the addition of a maximum of three conditions for the same cell in the Biff8 format.
- However, this restriction is removed in Excel 2007 formats.

- Discusses the use of Icon Sets to create visual effects in data for comparison purposes.

## Content

### New Formatting Rule Dialog Box
The *New Formatting Rule* dialog box provides various options to apply formatting rules based on cell values. Here's an overview of the options:

#### Select a Rule Type:
- **Format all cells based on their values**
- **Format only cells that contain**
- **Format only top or bottom ranked values**
- **Format only values that are above or below average**
- **Format only unique or duplicate values**
- **Use a formula to determine which cells to format**

#### Edit the Rule Description:
- When selecting "Format all cells based on their values," you can use options like *2-Color Scale* to visually represent data values.

#### Preview:
The dialog allows you to preview how the formatting will appear, using a color scale ranging from "Minimum" to "Maximum." For example:
- **Minimum**: Lowest Value (Orange)
- **Maximum**: Highest Value (Yellow)

#### Example Screenshot
![New Formatting Rule Dialog Box](https://example.com/image_link)

#### Explanation
The dialog is shown in Figure 53:

**Figure 53: New Formatting Dialog Box for setting Color Scales**

This feature allows users to apply conditional formatting to visually represent data trends and comparisons.

### Icon Sets
Icon Sets offer an opportunity to:
- **Create visual effects** in your data.
- **Compare cell values** with others.
- Choose from **multiple icon sets** available in **Excel 2007**.

#### Key Features:
- **Customizable icons** that reflect the data meaningfully.
- **Three sizes** for icon scaling, adjusting appropriately with font size changes.

#### Example:
Select the most appropriate icon set and size to represent your data effectively.

## Conclusion
Both color scales and icon sets are powerful tools for enhancing the visual representation of data in Excel, allowing for clearer communications and comparisons.

<!--  -->
## Icon Sets

Icon Sets give you an opportunity to create visual effects in your data, to see how the value of a cell compares with other cells. Excel 2007 offers several choices of icon sets. You can choose the icons that are most appropriate for the data you are using. Icon sets come in three sizes, so as you increase or decrease the font size, the icon becomes larger or smaller, appropriately.

# Range Manipulation

The IRange interface represents a single cell or a group of cells in a worksheet. XlsIO has several useful methods for manipulating the data and formatting it in the ranges. This section discusses the topics listed below.

## Overview

- Accessing a Range
- IMigrant Range
- Copying/Moving a Range
- Clearing a Range
- Getting Used Range

### Accessing a Range

Range of cells can be accessed through the IRange interface. Following code example illustrates this.

```csharp
// Get cell range.
IRange this[string name] { get; }

// Gets/sets cell by row and index.
IRange this[int row, int column] { get; }

// Get cell range.
IRange this[string name, bool IsR1C1Notation] { get; }

// Get cells range.
IRange this[int row, int column, int lastRow, int lastColumn] { get; }
```

### Note: Here row and column indexes in the range are "one based". Following code example explains various ways of accessing cells.

```csharp
// Method 1 to Access a Range.
sheet.Range["A7"].Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 1)";

// Method 2 to Access a Range.
sheet.Range[9, 1].Text = "Accessing a Range (Method 2)";
```

## API Reference

The `IRange` interface provides methods for accessing, copying, moving, clearing, and getting the used range of cells in a worksheet.

## Code Examples

### Accessing a Range

Here's an example of accessing a range using different methods:

```csharp
// Method 1: Using cell name
IRange range1 = sheet["A7"];

// Method 2: Using row and column indices
IRange range2 = sheet[9, 1];

// Method 3: Using cell name with R1C1 notation
IRange range3 = sheet["A7", true];

// Method 4: Using a range of cells
IRange range4 = sheet[1, 1, 10, 10];
```

# Essential XlsIO

### Copying a Range

```vb.net
' Copying a Range.
Dim source As IRange = sheet.Range("A1")
Dim des As IRange = sheet.Range("A5")
source.CopyTo(des)
```

**MoveTo** method is used for moving a range of cells to the destination. The only difference between copy and move operation is that Move will not create a copy in the source. This is similar to the **Cut** and **Paste** option in Excel.

**Note:** Move does not update formulas.

```csharp
// Moving a Range.
Dim source As IRange = sheet.Range("A1")
Dim des As IRange = sheet.Range("A5")
source.MoveTo(des)
```

```vb.net
' Moving a Range.
Dim source As IRange = sheet.Range("A1")
Dim des As IRange = sheet.Range("A5")
source.MoveTo(des)
```

### Clearing a Range

While editing Excel workbooks, one of the most common action that users perform is clearing or deleting cells. Clearing cells mean erasing everything within them, whereas deleting actually deletes the entire cell. You can clear the cell content by using the **Clear** method. XlsIO also provides options to clear styles or data alone.

Following code example illustrates how to clear a range along with its formatting.

```csharp
// Clearing a Range and its formatting.
sheet.Range["A4"].Clear(true);
```

## Content

### Insert Rows and Columns

#### Inserting Multiple Rows and Columns

You can insert multiple rows and columns in an Excel sheet using the following methods:

- **C#**
  ```csharp
  ' Inserting multiple rows.
  sheet.InsertRow(rowIndex, rowCount);

  ' Inserting multiple columns.
  sheet.InsertColumn(colIndex, colCount);
  ```

- **VB.NET**
  ```vb
  ' Inserting multiple columns.
  sheet.InsertColumn(colIndex, colCount)

  ' Inserting multiple rows.
  sheet.InsertRow(rowIndex, rowCount)
  ```

**Preserving Row/Column Formats**

You can also preserve the previous or next row/column formats by using XlsIO. The following code example illustrates this:

- **C#**
  ```csharp
  sheet.InsertRow(rowIndex, count, ExcelInsertOptions.FormatAsBefore);
  ```

- **VB.NET**
  ```vb
  sheet.InsertRow(rowIndex, count, ExcelInsertOptions.FormatAsBefore)
  ```

**Note:** Here, the row and column index of the `Insert` methods are "one based".

### ExcelInsertOptions Enumerator

The following table lists the options provided by the `ExcelInsertOptions` enumerator.

| **Member name**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FormatAsBefore    | Indicates that after the insert operation, the inserted rows/columns must be formatted as the row above or column left. |
| FormatAsAfter     | Indicates that after the insert operation, the inserted rows/columns must be formatted as the row below or column right. |
| FormatDefault     | Indicates that after the insert operation, the inserted rows/columns must have the default format.                          |

## Customizing Cell Dimensions in XlsIO

This section discusses ways to customize the cell width and height according to user needs. There are two methods to adjust cell size:

### Methods to Change Cell Size

- **Manual Adjustment:** Changing the row height and column width manually, with the values specified.
- **Automatic Adjustment:** Changing the row height and column width automatically, to fit the text into the cell.

This is discussed in the following topics.

### 4.1.3.3.1.1 Row Height and Column Width

**MS Excel:**
MS Excel allows setting the row height and column width using the **Format** menu option. Go to the **Format** menu, click **Row/Column**, and then click **Height/Width** option.

![Row Height and Column Width dialog boxes in Excel](https://i.imgur.com/4i8Bqkr.png)
*Figure 61: Row Height and Column Width dialog boxes in Excel*

#### Specifying Row Height and Column Width in XlsIO

**Column Width:**
XlsIO allows specifying a column width of 0 to 255 in a spreadsheet. This value represents the number of characters that can be displayed in a cell formatted with the standard font. The default column width is 8.43 characters, which is the default value of MS Excel. If a column has a width of 0, it is hidden.

**Row Height:**
Similarly, you can specify a row height of 0 to 409. Note that this is the restriction of MS Excel. This value represents the height measurement in points (1 point equals approximately 1/72 inch or \(0.035 \, \text{cm}\)). The default row height is 12.75 points. If a row has a height of 0, the row is hidden.

XlsIO provides support for setting the **RowHeight** and **ColumnWidth** properties in a worksheet. You can also set the column width and row height in pixels using the **IWorksheet.SetColumnWidthInPixel** and **IWorksheet.SetRowHeightInPixel** methods respectively.

### Code Example

```csharp
// Changing the Column Width.
sheet.Range["A1"].ColumnWidth = 20;
```

## Autofit Techniques in XlsIO

### Overview
- XlsIO provides support to autofit contents in a worksheet by adjusting the size of cells, ranges, columns, or rows.
- Demonstrates various autofit techniques supported by XlsIO.

### Autofit Single Row/Column

XlsIO allows you to resize cells in a column or row based on the given row/column index. The following code example illustrates autofitting a single row or column.

#### C# Example

```csharp
sheet.Range["E1"].Text = "This is the Long Text";

// AutoFit applied to a Single Column.
sheet.AutoFitColumn(5);

// AutoFit applied to a Single Row.
sheet.AutoFitRow(1);
```

#### VB.NET Example

```vb.net
sheet.Range("E1").Text = "This is the Long Text"

' AutoFit applied to a Single Column.
sheet.AutoFitColumn(5)

' AutoFit applied to a Single Row.
sheet.AutoFitRow(1)
```

**Note:** These indexes are "one based".

##### Alternative Autofit for Single Row/Column

You can also autofit single row/column as follows.

```csharp
sheet.Rows[0].AutoFitRows();
sheet.Columns[0].AutoFitColumns();
```

### Summary

This section provides a clear explanation of how to use the autofit feature in XlsIO to adjust the dimensions of rows and columns dynamically based on their content, ensuring optimal worksheet display.

### Hiding and Unhiding Rows in XlsIO

- **Introduction**: XlsIO provides functionality to hide/unhide rows and columns using ShowRow, ShowColumn, and ShowRange methods.
- **Purpose**: This section explains how to use these methods effectively with code examples.

## Content

### Key Concepts

- **Hiding Rows and Columns**: 
  - Rows and columns can be hidden programmatically using the ShowRow and ShowColumn methods.
  - Boolean flag determines whether to show (true) or hide (false) a specific row or column.

### Code Examples

```csharp
[C#]

// Hiding the First Column and Second Row.
sheet.ShowColumn( 1, false );
sheet.ShowRow( 2, false );

// Hiding the Fifth Column and Fifth Row.
sheet.ShowColumn( 5, false );
sheet.ShowRow( 5, false );

// Unhiding the Fifth Column and Second Row.
sheet.ShowColumn( 5, true );
sheet.ShowRow( 2, true );

IRange range = sheet[1, 4];
//Hiding the first to third row and first to third column
sheet.ShowRange(range, false);

IRange firstRange = ws[1, 1,3,3];
IRange secondRange = ws[5, 5, 7, 7];
RangesCollection rangeCollection = new RangesCollection(app, ws);
rangeCollection.Add(firstRange);
rangeCollection.Add(secondRange);
//Hiding the collection of ranges
ws.ShowRange(rangeCollection, false);
```

### Explanation

- **Hiding Individual Rows/Columns**:
  - The `ShowColumn` and `ShowRow` methods are used to hide or show specific columns or rows based on their index and a boolean flag.
  
- **Hiding Ranges**:
  - The `ShowRange` method allows you to hide or show a specific range of cells defined by their coordinates.
  
- **Hiding Multiple Ranges**:
  - You can create a `RangesCollection` to group multiple ranges and hide or show them all at once.

## API Reference

### Methods

- **ShowColumn**: Hides or shows a specific column in a worksheet.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `columnIndex`: The index of the column to be hidden/shown.
    - `isVisible`: A boolean flag indicating whether to show (true) or hide (false) the column.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Locking and unlocking cells using the `Locked` property in XlsIO.
- Manipulating the `Locked` property to control cell editability in protected worksheets.
- The importance of worksheet protection for guarded editing scenarios.

## Content

### Cell Locking and Unlocking

XlsIO supports locking and unlocking cells by using the cell's **Locked** property, which can be manipulated to make certain cells editable in a protected worksheet. Please note that locking/unlocking a cell in an unprotected worksheet has no effect. For protecting the worksheet, see [Worksheet Protection](#).

**[C#]**

```csharp
// Opening the Existing (Protected) Worksheet from a Workbook
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("CellProtectionTemplate.xls");

// Unlocking the cell which, need to be edited.
sheet.Range["A1"].CellStyle.Locked = false;
```

**[VB.NET]**

```vbnet
' Opening the Existing (Protected) Worksheet from a Workbook
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("CellProtectionTemplate.xls")

' Unlocking the cells which, need to be edited.
sheet.Range("A1").CellStyle.Locked = False
```

### 4.1.4 Clipboard

The office clipboard in Excel is an extension of the Windows clipboard, and allows for easy transfer of data, by using the **Copy** and **Paste** commands. XlsIO provides support to copy a worksheet or workbook to the clipboard. It can be done by using the **CopyToClipboard** method as follows.

**[C#]**

```csharp
sheet.CopyToClipboard();
workbook.CopyToClipboard();
```

**[VB.NET]**

```vbnet
sheet.CopyToClipboard();
workbook.CopyToClipboard();
```

## Overview
- Instructions on editing group data and location for Sparklines.
- Customization options for Line Weight in line sparkline types.
- Discussion on handling hidden and empty cell settings for Sparklines.

## Content

### Sparkline Group Styling
```csharp
sparklineGroup.FirstPointColor = Color.Green;
sparklineGroup.LastPointColor = Color.DarkOrange;
sparklineGroup.HighPointColor = Color.DarkBlue;
sparklineGroup.LowPointColor = Color.DarkViolet;
sparklineGroup.MarkersColor = Color.Black;
```

### Edit Group Data and Location
MS Excel provides an option to edit the location and group data of an existing Sparklines, by which you can assign a new location or group data for an existing sparklines. XlsIO provides an equivalent API to perform this functionality.

```csharp
[C#]
sparklines.RefreshRanges(dataRange, referenceRange);
```

### Line Weight
MS Excel 2010 provides an exclusive option to customize the Line Weight of the Line Sparkline type. XlsIO provides an API to perform this functionality.

```csharp
[C#]

### 4.2.6 Pivot Tables

Pivot Tables is an Excel feature that helps in summarizing large data. Instead of analyzing rows upon rows of records, a pivot table can aggregate your data and show a new perspective with few clicks. You can also move columns to rows or vice versa. You can create the table by defining which fields to view, and how the data should be displayed. Based on the field selections, Excel aggregates and organizes the data so that you can see a different view of your data.

Essential XlsIO supports the usage of Pivot Table. Creation and Manipulation of pivot table is supported in Excel 2007 format, and pivot table in existing document can be preserved for Excel 2003 format. The following topics illustrate this.

#### 4.2.6.1 Excel 2003

XlsIO supports the usage of Pivot Tables in a Template file. It is even possible to dynamically refresh the data in a pivot table by using XlsIO. The following steps illustrate how to do this.

- Create the pivot table using MS Excel GUI.
- Specify the named range to be the data source of the pivot table.
- Make sure that the "Refresh On Open" option of the pivot table is selected.
- Dynamically refresh the data in the Named Range.

Calculated fields are a special type of database field that perform calculations by using the contents of other fields in the pivot table with the given formula. The formula can contain operators and expressions as in other worksheet formulas. You can use constants and refer to data from the PivotTable. XlsIO supports reading and creating the Calculated Fields in the existing pivot table. The following are MS Excel restriction when using the formula:

- **Formula cannot contain cell references or defined names.**
- **Formula cannot contain Worksheet functions that require cell references.**
- **Formula cannot use array functions.**

In MS Excel, the Calculated Field can be added using the calculation option from the Option tab. In XlsIO, the same can be achieved with the following code sample.

#### Code Example in C#

```csharp
[CS#]

IPivotTable pivotTable = sheet.PivotTables[0];
IPivotField field = pivotTable.CalculatedFields.Add("Percent", "Sales/Total*100");
```

The formula can be fetched from the formula property of the IPivotField.

#### Retrieving the Formula

```csharp
[CS#]

field.Formula = "Sales/Total*100";
```

### Layouting the Pivot Table as MS Excel 2007

We have provided support for drawing a pivot table similar to the MS Excel layout using Essential XlsIO. Previously, we let MS Excel lay out the pivot table for XlsIO. By using a layout method, we draw the pivot table layout using XlsIO. Now we can get any values of the pivot table using XlsIO dynamically, apply a filter to the pivot table, and can get the filtered values of the pivot table dynamically.

#### Methods

| Method Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Layout      | Method to lay out the pivot table using XlsIO like the MS Excel pivot table layout. |

#### Code Example

The following code example illustrates how to enable Essential XlsIO to lay out the pivot table like MS Excel.

## Applying Built-In Styles and Saving Workbooks

### C#

```csharp
// Apply built-in style.
pivotTable.BuiltInStyle = PivotBuiltInStyles.PivotStyleMedium2;

// Activate the pivot worksheet.
pivotSheet.Activate();

// Save the workbook to disk.
workbook.SaveAs("PivotTable.xlsx");

// Close the workbook.
workbook.Close();

// No exception will be thrown if there are unsaved workbooks.
excelEngine.ThrowNotSavedOnDestroy = false;
excelEngine.Dispose();
```

### VB

```vb
' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
Dim excelEngine As New ExcelEngine()

' Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel

' Set the default version as Excel 2010.
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010

' Get the path of input file.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("PivotCodeDate.xlsx")

' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim worksheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)
```

## Code Examples

The above code snippets demonstrate how to:

1. **Apply a Built-In Style to a Pivot Table:**
   - Includes setting the built-in style.

### PivotCharts

PivotCharts are interactive graphical representations of PivotTable data that allow rapid analysis of the displayed data. PivotTable is an Excel feature that helps in summarizing large volumes of data, such as stock market reports, Cash flow reports, etc. A PivotTable can aggregate data instead of analyzing rows upon large volumes of records, and with a few clicks, the PivotChart allows rapid, dynamic, and flexible data analysis. The following sections describe the creation of PivotTables and PivotCharts.

#### PivotTable Creation

Kindly refer to the following topic for PivotTable creation:

- **Excel 2007**

#### PivotChart Creation Using MS Excel 2010

In Microsoft Excel, the PivotChart can be created using the PivotChart Option from the Insert menu. Refer to **Figure 98: PivotChart Creation**.

## API Reference

### Figure 97: Setting Value to the Filter

- **Label Filter (Region)**
  - **Show items for which the label** equals: East
  - Use `?` to represent any single character
  - Use `*` to represent any series of characters

### PivotTable Data Example

| Row Labels | Units |
|------------|-------|
| East       | 15.99 |
| East       | 19.99 |
| Grand Total|       |

### Note:

The PivotTable in the example shows the sum of units for the region labeled "East" with a grand total.

## 4.3.1 Page Setup

In MS Excel, the way the spreadsheet fits onto paper can be controlled through the **Page Setup** dialog box. You can select the size and orientation of the paper, the width of the margins, what goes into the header and footer of each page, and the order of printing cells for sheets that will take several pieces of paper.

**Note:** Though the sample code uses sheet object, it is possible to read/write page setup options for chart worksheet and embedded chart using `IChartPageSetup` interface.

There may also be a need to change the first page number, which starts with '1', by default. This can be done through the page number customization options provided by the Page Setup dialog box.

### Example Code: Changing the First Page Number

#### C#

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.AutoFirstPageNumber = false;
sheet.PageSetup.FirstPageNumber = 2;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
sheet.PageSetup.AutoFirstPageNumber = false
sheet.PageSetup.FirstPageNumber = 2;
```

Following topics explain how various other page setup options can be set by using XlsIO.

### 4.3.1.1 Margins

Page margins are the blank spaces between the worksheet data and the edges of the printed page, and hence provide better readability. Page margins can be used for items such as headers, footers and page numbers.

Excel allows to set the page margin through the Page Setup dialog box. Note that the page margins that you define in a given worksheet, are stored with that particular worksheet, when you save the workbook. You cannot change the default page margins for new workbooks.

#### 4.3.1.3 Paper Size

In order to fit information on a page or change the appearance of the page, you may want to customize your page layout. One better option is to change the paper size of the worksheet, as per the need.

The default paper size in Excel is 8 1/2" x 11" sheets, but it can be changed through the **Page Setup** dialog box. XlsIO allows to change the paper size through the **PaperSize** property.

**Figure 118: Formula Settings**

Note that formula separators vary for each culture/regional settings, and there will be exceptions in such cases. This can be overcome by setting the separators by using the `SetSeparators` method of `IWorkbook`. Following code example illustrates how to change the formula separators through XlsIO.

### Setting Formula Separators

#### [C#]

```csharp
Workbook.SetSeparators(";", ", ");
```

- **Sheet1 and Sheet2** are the default names of the worksheets.

#### [VB.NET]

#### Overview
- This section explains how to insert formulas that refer to values in other worksheets/workbooks using Essential XlsIO.
- It highlights the limitation that XlsIO can only write/preserve formulas, not update/refresh calculated values, which must be refreshed by MS Excel.

#### Content

Essential XlsIO allows you to insert/preserve formulas that refer values in other worksheets/workbooks. Note that XlsIO can only write/preserve formulas. You cannot update/refresh the calculated values in Excel, which should be refreshed by MS Excel.

Following code illustrates the insertion of a formula that refers to a value in another workbook.

##### C#
```csharp
// Write external Formula Value.
sheet.Range["C1"].Formula = "[One.xls]Sheet1!$A$1*5";
```

##### VB.NET
```vbnet
' Write external Formula Value.
sheet.Range("C1").Formula = "[One.xls]Sheet1!$A$1*5";

```csharp
workbook.CalculationOptions.IsIterationEnabled = true;
workbook.CalculationOptions.MaximumIteration = 99;
workbook.CalculationOptions.MaximumChange = 40;
```

```vb
[VB.NET]

Dim workbook as IWorkbook
workbook = application.Workbooks.Create()
workbook.CalculationOptions.IsIterationEnabled = true;
workbook.CalculationOptions.MaximumIteration = 99;
Workbook.CalculationOptions.MaximumChange = 40;
```

### 4.4.2.2 Calculation Engine

Essential XlsIO has a calculation engine of its own and can compute the values of the formula entered during runtime. Essential Calculate is now [from v9.1.x.x] integrated with Essential XlsIO, and thus makes it possible to get the values of the formula entered by using XlsIO during runtime, without any additional references or packages. Currently, there are over 180+ functions that are supported by this Calculate engine, which cover all common usage scenarios.

#### Sample Link

To understand this process, consider the sample project:

{Drive:\\}\\Program Files\\EssentialStudio\\*.**.* \\Windows\\XlsIO.Windows\\Samples\\2.0\\Data Management\\Compute All Formulas.

### 4.4.2.2.1 Adding Calculation Engine to an Application

#### Enable Formula Calculations:

Essential XlsIO includes support for enabling the calculations of Essential Calculate supported formulas that are added at runtime to the worksheet. The computed value will be set to the "CalculatedValue" property associated to the "IRange" object. The following code sample illustrates how to enable the sheet formula calculations.

```csharp
[C#]
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Formula calculation is enabled for the sheet.
sheet.EnableSheetCalculations();
string computedValue = sheet.Range["C1"].CalculatedValue;
```

#### Disable Formula Calculations:

## Essential XlsIO

### Note:

1. **In order to use the Essential XlsIO's Calculate engine, you have to add the following namespace:**
   - `using Syncfusion.Calculate`

2. **Do not add reference to Syncfusion.Calculate.Base. It will throw conflict errors as these are already integrated with XlsIO from Version 7.2.X.X.**

3. **Only the formulas that are supported by Calculate engine can be calculated at runtime using Essential XlsIO.**

### 4.4.3 Defined Names

#### Overview
- Named Ranges is a powerful feature in Excel, which makes it possible to assign a name to a group of cells.
- XlsIO has APIs for inserting new named ranges into workbooks, and also to read existing named ranges.
- Named Ranges are mainly used in formulae.

Named Ranges enables users with better readability, and at a glance we can predict what it is, and what we're adding up with the meaningful range names.

To create named ranges, open the **Insert menu**, point to **Name** and select **Define**. Names are created at workbook-level, by default, but you can create a sheet-level name, by entering the sheet name followed by an exclamation mark (!), followed by the name of the range. For instance, to create a named range "x" on Sheet1, open the **Insert menu**, point to **Name**, select **Define**, and enter the name as 'Sheet1!x'.

## Overview

- Demonstrates the creation and manipulation of named ranges in spreadsheet documents using `IName` interface.
- Explains how to retrieve, enumerate, and delete named ranges from a worksheet or workbook.
- Lists the properties of the `IName` interface for reference.

## Content

```vb
Dim lname1 As IName = sheet.Names.Add("CellName")
lname1.RefersToRange = sheet.Range("C3")

' Get name.
Console.WriteLine(sheet.Names("CellName").Value)
```

You can get/read all the names from a worksheet or workbook just by enumerating the `IName` collection as follows.

### C#

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i <= workbook.Names.Count; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].Name.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].RefersToRange.Address.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names[i].Name.Value.ToString());
}
```

### VB.NET

```vb
Dim i As Integer
For i = 0 To workbook.Names.Count Step i + 1
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names(i).Name.ToString())
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names(i).RefersToRange.Address.ToString())
    Console.WriteLine(workbook.Names(i).Name.Value.ToString())
Next
```

You can also delete a name in the workbook/worksheet by using the `Delete` method of `IName`. Note that deleting the cell does not delete the name from the `Name` collection.

### Properties of `IName`

Following table lists the properties of `IName`.

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All                   | Represents All flag of excel ignore error indicator.                |

Following code example illustrates how to ignore or set an error indicator.

```csharp
[C#]

// Sets warning if number is entered as text.
sheet.Range["A2:D2"].IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.NumberAsText;

// Ignores all the error warnings.
sheet.Range["A3"].IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.None;
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

' Sets warning if number is entered as text.
sheet.Range["A2:D2"].IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.NumberAsText

' Ignores all the error warnings.
sheet.Range["A3"].IgnoreErrorOptions = ExcelIgnoreError.None
```

## 4.5 Data

XlsIO has advanced support to work with data in a worksheet and here are some key functionalities that makes it easier.

### 4.5.1 Filter

MS Excel **AutoFilter** feature literally makes filtering out unwanted data in a data list, as easy as clicking a button. When the cell pointer is located within any cell in your data list, open the **Data** menu, point to **Filter**, and select **AutoFilter**. Once this is done, the program adds drop-down buttons to each of the field names in the top row of the list. This feature is specifically used in large spreadsheets, when the user wants to look for particular data, based on some criteria.

validation.IsPromptBoxVisible = true;
validation.ShowPromptBox = true;
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' Data validation to list the values in the first cell.
Dim validation As IDataValidation = sheet.Range("A1").DataValidation
sheet.Range("A1").Text = "Data validation list"
validation.ListOfValues = New String() {"ListItem1", "ListItem2", "ListItem3"}
validation.PromptBoxText = "Data Validation list"
validation.IsPromptBoxVisible = True
validation.ShowPromptBox = True
```

### Error Alert Settings

The following screenshots illustrate the error alert settings through the **Data Validation** dialog box in MS Excel.

**Figure 131: Error Alert Options in MS Excel**

![Error Alert Options in MS Excel](https://i.imgur.com/Fig131.png)

The settings shown include:
- **Show error alert after invalid data is entered**
- **Style**: Warning
- **Title**: ERROR
- **Error message**: RetySe text length to 25 character

### Example of Error Alert Settings

The screenshot depicts:
- A checkbox indicating to show an error alert after invalid data is entered.
- Options to customize the alert style (Warning in this case).
- The title of the error alert and the error message that will be displayed.

## Code Examples

Here are the complete code snippets for setting up data validation with error alerts:

### C#

```csharp
// Configuring Data Validation
IWorkbook workbook = new Workbook();
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

IDataValidation validation = sheet.Range["A1"].DataValidation;
validation.ListOfValues = new string[] { "ListItem1", "ListItem2", "ListItem3" };
validation.PromptBoxText = "Data Validation list";
validation.IsPromptBoxVisible = true;
validation.ShowPromptBox = true;

// Configuring Error Alert
validation.ShowErrorAlert = true;
validation.ErrorStyle = ErrorStyle.Warning;
validation.ErrorTitle = "ERROR";
validation.ErrorMessage = "Retry text length to 25 character";

workbook.Save("Output.xlsx");
```

### VB.NET

## Template Marker representing the HeaderName and NumberFormat

### Overview
- Illustrates the binding of data from a business object to a marker.
- Focuses on using the `NumberFormat` and `HeaderName` arguments.

### Content

#### Code Example
The following code demonstrates the creation and usage of a `TemplateMarkerProcessor` to process markers in a template, specifically within the context of a business object (`Customer`). The code also includes examples of binding business object data to markers with specified formats and headers.

```csharp
set
{
    m_salesPerson = value;
}

}

public int Sold
{
    get
    {
        return m_sold ;
    }
    set
    {
        m_sold = value;
    }
}

}

public Customer(string name, int sold)
{
    this.m_salesPerson = name;
    this.m_sold = sold;
}

}

// Creating Template Marker Processor
// Northwind Customers Table
ITemplateMarkersProcessor marker = workbook.CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor();
marker.AddVariable("Sales", arrSalesPerson);

// Processing the markers in the template
marker.ApplyMarkers();
```

#### Key Points
- The `Customer` class contains properties like `SalesPerson` and `Sold`, which are used to store sales-related information.
- The `Customer` constructor initializes these properties with the provided arguments.
- The `TemplateMarkerProcessor` is created to handle template markers, where variables like `Sales` are dynamically replaced with the actual sales data.
- The `ApplyMarkers()` method processes the template, replacing markers with the corresponding data.

### Template Marker Discussion
The template markers are used to insert formatted data directly into the Excel template:
- `NumberFormat` ensures that the data is displayed in the specified numerical format.
- `HeaderName` allows setting a custom header for the column or cell where the data is displayed.

### API Reference

#### Class: `Customer`
- **Properties:**
  - `SalesPerson`: Stores the salesperson's name as a `string`.
  - `Sold`: Stores the quantity sold as an `int`.

- **Constructor:**
  - `public Customer(string name, int sold)`: Initializes the `SalesPerson` and `Sold` properties.

#### Interface: `ITemplateMarkersProcessor`
- **Methods:**
  - `CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor()`: Creates a new instance of the `TemplateMarkerProcessor`.
  - `AddVariable(string name, object value)`: Adds a variable to the template with the specified name and value.
  - `ApplyMarkers()`: Processes all markers in the template, replacing them with the corresponding data.

### Code Examples

#### Example Usage
```csharp
// Assume arrSalesPerson is an array of Customer objects
ITemplateMarkersProcessor marker = workbook.CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor();
marker.AddVariable("Sales", arrSalesPerson);
marker.ApplyMarkers();
```

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to insert and process markers in an Excel template using XlsIO.
- Explains inserting different types of markers, including simple markers, markers that retrieve values, and markers that include cell addresses.
- Provides code examples in both C# and VB.NET languages for creating and applying markers.

## Content

### Marker Usage in XlsIO

This section showcases how to utilize markers within an Excel template using the XlsIO library. Markers allow dynamic content insertion into the template based on variables and cell ranges.

#### Code Example: C#

```csharp
// Insert Simple marker.
sheet.Range["B2"].Text = "%Marker";

// Insert marker which gets value of Author name.
sheet.Range["C2"].Text = "%Marker2.Worksheet.Workbook.Author";

// Insert marker which gets cell address.
sheet.Range["H2"].Text = "%ArrayProperty.Cells.Address";

ITemplateMarkersProcessor marker = workbook.CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor();
marker.AddVariable("Marker", "First test of markers");
marker.AddVariable("Marker2", sheet.Range["B2"]);
marker.AddVariable("ArrayProperty", sheet.Range["B2:G2"]);

// Process the markers in the template.
marker.ApplyMarkers();
```

#### Code Example: VB.NET

```vb
' Insert Simple marker.
sheet.Range("B2").Text = "%Marker"

' Insert marker which gets value of Author name.
sheet.Range("C2").Text = "%Marker2.Worksheet.Workbook.Author"

' Insert marker which gets cell address.
sheet.Range("H2").Text = "%ArrayProperty.Cells.Address"

Dim marker As ITemplateMarkersProcessor = workbook.CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor()
marker.AddVariable("Marker", "First test of markers")
marker.AddVariable("Marker2", sheet.Range("B2"))
marker.AddVariable("ArrayProperty", sheet.Range("B2:G2"))

' Process the markers in the template.
marker.ApplyMarkers()
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Inserting Simple Markers**:
   - The simplest marker (`"%Marker"`) is inserted into cell B2. This marker will be replaced by a predefined value during the marker processing phase.

2. **Markers Retrieving Values**:
   - The marker (`"%Marker2.Worksheet.Workbook.Author"`) in cell C2 retrieves the value of the author from the workbook's properties and replaces the marker with this value.

3. **Markers with Cell Addresses**:
   - The marker (`"%ArrayProperty.Cells.Address"`) in cell H2 inserts the address of the range `sheet.Range["B2:G2"]`. This demonstrates how markers can reference cell addresses from a specified range.

4. **Creating and Applying Markers**:
   - The `ITemplateMarkersProcessor` is created and used to define the variables that will replace the markers in the template. The `AddVariable` method associates each marker with its respective value or range.
   - The markers are processed using the `ApplyMarkers` method, which replaces all the markers in the template with their corresponding values or references.

## API Reference

### Methods

- **`CreateTemplateMarkersProcessor()`**: Creates a new `ITemplateMarkersProcessor` to handle the processing of markers.
- **`AddVariable(String Name, Object Value)`**: Associates a variable name with its corresponding value or range.
- **`ApplyMarkers()`**: Processes all the markers in the template, replacing them with their defined values.

### Usage

This functionality is particularly useful for creating dynamic reports or templates where content needs to be generated based on predefined variables or cell ranges.

## Code Examples

### C#

The above C# example demonstrates creating and applying markers that retrieve values from different sources, including fixed text, workbook properties, and cell addresses.

### VB.NET

The VB.NET example is equivalent to the C# example, performing the same tasks of inserting and processing markers within an Excel template.

### Using Add-In Functions in XlsIO

```vb
[VB.NET]

Dim unknownFunctions As IAddInFunctions = workbook.AddInFunctions
unknownFunctions.Add("c:\blp\api\dde\blp.xla", "blp")

' Use the Function.
sheet.Range("A3").Formula = "blp(A1+"" CORP"",""PX_LAST"")"
```

**Note:** If you move the file to another computer, or distribute it, the workbook will expect to find the same Add-In, in the same place, on their computers. But, if the Add-In is moved or deleted from the computer, the workbook won't be able to find it, and your code won't work. Make sure that the Add-In is accessed by locating the .xla file through the Tools menu (Tools -> Addins -> Browse).

## API Reference

- **Namespace:** Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel
- **Class:** IAddInFunctions
- **Method:** Add()
  - **Parameters:**
    - **Path (String):** The file path of the Add-In.
    - **FunctionName (String):** The name of the function to be added.
  - **Returns:** None.
  - **Description:** Adds a custom function from the specified Add-In to the workbook.

## Code Examples

### Example: Adding and Using a Custom Function

This example demonstrates how to add a custom function from a .xla file and use it in your workbook.

```vb
' Adding the Add-In function
Dim unknownFunctions As IAddInFunctions = workbook.AddInFunctions
unknownFunctions.Add("c:\blp\api\dde\blp.xla", "blp")

' Using the custom function in a cell
sheet.Range("A3").Formula = "blp(A1+"" CORP"",""PX_LAST"")"
```

### Example: Dynamic Function Addition

You can add multiple functions from the same or different Add-Ins dynamically based on requirements.

```vb
Dim unknownFunctions As IAddInFunctions = workbook.AddInFunctions
unknownFunctions.Add("c:\path\to\add-in.xla", "functionName1")
unknownFunctions.Add("c:\another\path\xla", "functionName2")

' Use the functions in different cells
sheet.Range("B3").Formula = "functionName1(A1)"
sheet.Range("C3").Formula = "functionName2(B1)"
```

### 5.1.18 How to Create Template Markers Using XlsIO?

Report created in Excel provides ordered and rich look for large datasets. This article focuses on creating an Excel report using template markers. A template marker is a special marker symbol created in an Excel template which will be bound the required user data. Essential XlsIO allows you to create and bind the template markers to data from various sources, such as data table, variables and arrays. This allows the user to control the data formats for the data bound to the template document.

#### How Does it Work?

Markers are applied in the template to the required cells. This will include the data source name and field name of interest. During data binding a search is conducted for the data source name and the field name in the Excel workbook and the corresponding data from the data source is bound to the marker. Cells in the worksheet can be filled with single data source or with multiple records. Format of these data can be changed using the arguments of the markers.

#### What is the Syntax of the Markers in Template?

Each marker starts with some prefix (by default it is “%” character) and followed by the variable name and properties. There could be several arguments after a variable which are delimited by some character (by default it is semicolon “;”).

## Overview
- Explains how to compress directories using the `AddDirectory` method.
- Demonstrates adding all files inside a directory using the `AddItem` method.
- Provides examples in C# and VB.NET for adding files to a ZIP archive.
- Illustrates how to zip all files in subfolders using the `Syncfusion.Compression.Zip` namespace.

## Content

### Adding Files to a ZIP Archive

#### For compressing directories, you can make use of the AddDirectory method. The AddDirectory method adds an empty directory file to a ZipArchive. If you want to add all the files inside the directory, then you should manually add these files by using the AddItem method.

For example, you can use the following code to add the file from the local drive.

#### C#

```csharp
string fileName = @"C:\Form1.cs";
Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive zipArchive = new Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive();
zipArchive.DefaultCompressionLevel = Syncfusion.Compression.CompressionLevel.Best;
Stream stream = new FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
FileAttributes attributes = File.GetAttributes(fileName);
Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchiveItem item = new Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchiveItem("Form1.cs", stream, true, attributes);
zipArchive.AddItem(item);
zipArchive.Save(@"c:\\SyncfusionCompressFileSample.zip");
zipArchive.Close();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
Dim fileName As String = "C:\Form1.cs"
Dim zipArchive As New Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchive()
zipArchive.DefaultCompressionLevel = Syncfusion.Compression.CompressionLevel.Best
Dim stream As IO.Stream = New IO.FileStream(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)
Dim attributes As IO.FileAttributes = File.GetAttributes(fileName)
Dim item As New Syncfusion.Compression.Zip.ZipArchiveItem("Form1.cs", stream, True, attributes)
zipArchive.AddItem(item)
zipArchive.Save("c:\\SyncfusionCompressFileSample.zip")
zipArchive.Close()
```

### How to zip all the files in subfolders using the Syncfusion.Compression.Zip namespace?

The following code example illustrates how to zip all files in subfolders in XlsIO by using the Syncfusion.Compression.Zip namespace.

## API Reference

### Zip Archive Operations
- **AddDirectory()**: Adds an empty directory to a zip archive.
- **AddItem()**: Adds specific files or streams to a zip archive.
- **Save()**: Saves the zip archive to a specified location.

### Compression Levels
- **Best**: Specifies the compression level for the zip archive.

## Code Examples

#### Zipping Files in Subfolders

Essential XlsIO library can be used in any .NET environment including C#, VB.NET and managed C++. It is a Non-UI component that can be used in ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF and Silverlight applications, without any change in the API. The usage is common for all the environments, except for the part where the created spreadsheet is saved to disk or stream in the case of a Windows Forms/WPF application and streamed to the client browser in the case of Web applications; there are no temporary Excel files created on the server in an ASP.NET application. Essential XlsIO comes with support for working with formulas in the cells and provides data and worksheet manipulation support. It is known for its high performance for generating Excel files with large number of rows and columns. It is possible to create and modify Excel charts inside a workbook and also has options to secure its contents.

XlsIO can read and write Excel files that are compatible with Excel 97 to Excel 2010. The same Excel file created by using XlsIO can be opened by the following versions of MS Excel. There is no need to create separate files for different versions of Excel.

- Excel 97 (.xls)
- Excel 2000 (.xls)
- Excel 2002 (.xls)
- Excel 2003 (.xls)
- SpreadsheetML (.xlsx)
- CSV (.csv)
- Excel 2007 (.xlsx)
- Excel 2010 (.xlsx)

   IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(5);
   ```

   **VB.NET**
   ```vb.net
   ' A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].
   ' The new workbook will have 5 worksheets.
   Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(5)
   ```

A workbook with the mentioned number of worksheets is created in the Excel document.

**Note:** See **Workbook** and **Worksheet**, for more details.

### Accessing and Setting Data in a Worksheet

2. Access the worksheet in the workbook and set the data for the given range, say "A1".

   **C#**
   ```csharp
   // The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
   IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

   // Inserting sample text into the first cell of the first worksheet.
   sheet.Range["A1"].Text = "Hello World";
   ```

   **VB.NET**
   ```vb.net
   ' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
   Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)
   ```

## API Reference

### Methods and Properties
- **application.Workbooks.Create(int worksheetsCount)**: Creates a new workbook with the specified number of worksheets.
- **workbook.Worksheets[0]**: Accesses the first worksheet in the workbook.
- **sheet.Range[string cellAddress].Text**: Sets the text value of the specified cell.

## Code Examples

### C# Example
```csharp
// Initialize Excel
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(5)
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0]
sheet.Range["A1"].Text = "Hello World"
' Save the workbook
workbook.Save("output.xlsx")
application.Exit()
```

### VB.NET Example
```vb.net
' Initialize Excel
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create(5)
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)
sheet.Range("A1").Text = "Hello World"
' Save the workbook

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- This page provides steps to deploy Essential XlsIO in an ASP.NET application.

## Content

### 1. Marking the Application Directory

The appropriate directory, usually where the aspx files are stored, must be marked as Application in IIS.

### 2. Syncfusion Assemblies

The following Syncfusion assemblies need to be in the `bin` folder that is beside the aspx files:

- Syncfusion.Core.dll
- Syncfusion.Compression.Base.dll
- Syncfusion.XlsIO.Base.dll

They can also be in the GAC, in which case, they should be referenced in the `Web.config` file using the following code:

```xml
[ASPX]
<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <compilation>
            <assemblies>
                <add assembly="Syncfusion.XlsIO.Base, Version=x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=3D67ED1F87D44C89" />
            </assemblies>
        </compilation>
        ...
    </system.web>
</configuration>
```

**Note:** `X.X.X` in the above code corresponds to the correct version number of the Essential Studio version that you are currently using.

### Additional Resources

Please refer to the document in the following location for a step-by-step process of Syncfusion assemblies deployment in ASP.NET:

```plaintext

// The instantiation process consists of two steps.

// Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
```

```vb
' New instance of XlsIO is created. [Equivalent to launching MS Excel with no workbooks open].
' The instantiation process consists of two steps.

' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Guide to deploying and using Essential XlsIO in an ASP.NET MVC application.
- Instructions for creating an Excel document with worksheets.

## Content

### Deployment of Essential XlsIO

1. **Note**: X.X.X.X in the above code corresponds to the correct version number of the Essential Studio version that you are currently using.
2. Add the following under the `<namespaces>` tag of Web.config file.

#### Web.config Configuration
```xml
<namespaces>
    ....
    <add namespace="Syncfusion.XlsIO"/>
</namespaces>
```

Essential XlsIO is now deployed in your ASP.NET MVC application.

### Creating and Adding an Excel Document (With Worksheets) to the Application

The following steps illustrate how to create a worksheet in an MVC application.

#### Step 1: View

Add a `Button` to the aspx page in the View, as illustrated by the following code:

```aspx
[ASPX]
<% Html.BeginForm("createsheet", "GettingStarted", FormMethod.Post);
    %>
<input type="submit" value="Create Document" />
<% 
    Html.EndForm(); 
%>
```

#### Step 2: Create a Custom ActionResult Class

In an MVC application, the controller returns an action result. In particular, it returns an action that derives from the base `ActionResult` class. 

But, if you want to return some other type of content to a browser, such as an image, a XlsIO file, or a Microsoft Excel document, you need to create your own action result. The following code example illustrates how to create a custom action result:

```csharp
public class ExcelActionResult : ActionResult
{
    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
    {
        // Implementation for custom result (e.g., creating and returning an Excel file)
    }
}
```

## API Reference

Refer to the official Syncfusion documentation for more information on `Syncfusion.XlsIO` namespace and its features.

## Code Examples

The provided code examples demonstrate how to integrate `Syncfusion.XlsIO` into an MVC application to create and manipulate Excel documents.

### Creating and Saving an Excel File as SpreadsheetML

The following code examples illustrate how to create a new Excel file, write data, and save it as a SpreadsheetML file.

#### C# Example
```csharp
// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Write data
sheet.Range["C3:O28"].Text = "Hello world";

// Save as SpreadsheetML.
workbook.SaveAsXml("Sample.xml", ExcelXmlSaveType.MSExcel);
```

#### VB.NET Example
``` vb
' Create a new workbook
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Create(3)

' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

' Write data
sheet.Range("C3:O28").Text = "Hello world"

' Save as SpreadsheetML.
workbook.SaveAsXml("Sample.xml", ExcelXmlSaveType.MSExcel)
```

### Opening an Existing SpreadsheetML File

The following code example illustrates how to open an existing SpreadsheetML file, modify its content, and save it.

#### C# Example
```csharp
// Open an existing SpreadsheetML file.
IWorkbook workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("spreadsheetml.xml", ExcelXmlOpenType.MSExcel);

// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Write data
sheet.Range["C3:O28"].Text = "Hello world";

// Save as SpreadsheetML.
workbook.SaveAsXml("Sample.xml", ExcelXmlSaveType.MSExcel);
```

#### VB.NET Example
```vb
' Open an existing SpreadsheetML file.
' Additional VB.NET code to open and modify the file would follow here.
```

## Notes
- Ensure that the `excelEngine` object is properly initialized before executing these code snippets.
- The `ExcelXmlSaveType.MSExcel` parameter specifies that the file should be saved in a format compatible with Microsoft Excel.

## Text Alignment

Text has to be aligned inside the cells to properly fit in any data. This is done in Excel by using the Horizontal and Vertical alignment settings either through the Formatting toolbar or through the options provided by the Alignment tab in the Format Cells dialog box. In addition to the Left, Center, and Right alignments, Horizontal alignment option goes further and allows text to be justified. This can be especially useful if the text is significantly long. Vertical alignment option allows you to align the contents of a cell towards the Top, Middle, or Bottom area of a cell.

![Figure 36: Alignment Settings in MS Excel](36)

## Indentation

In some circumstances, you may neither want to center the text nor keep it left or right aligned. In such cases, indentation can be done. Indentation consists of "pushing" the text to the left or right, without aligning it to center. To indent a text, you need to specify the number of units in the Indent box.

## Alignment Settings in XlsIO

XlsIO supports alignment properties similar to Excel. The following code example illustrates the alignment settings that can be applied to the cells by using XlsIO.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates vertical and horizontal alignment settings in Excel.
- Provides examples of different formatting options to control the appearance of text in cells.
- Explains the importance of number formatting in determining the display of numerical values in Excel.

## Content

### 4.1.1.3 Number Formatting

Number Formats are little code that help you control the appearance of numbers in the Excel. A number in a cell is displayed depending on the number format applied to it. The same number can be displayed in different formats also. For example, 1.5 might represent a half teaspoon in one spreadsheet, while the same 1.5 would represent somebody's age, another spreadsheet's percentage, or so on.

Microsoft Excel recognizes the numbers in various formats: Accounting, Scientific, Fractions, and Currency. MS Excel allows to set these number formats by using the Number tab in the Format Cells dialog box.

### Figure: XlsIO with Alignment Settings

```markdown
Figure 37: XlsIO with Alignment Settings

- **Horizontal Alignment (HAlign)**:
  - HAlignFill & VAlignCenter
  - HAlignRight & VAlignTop
  - HAlignCenterAcrossSection & VAlignDistributed

- **Vertical Alignment (VAlign)**:
  - VAlignCenter
  - VAlignTop
  - VAlignDistributed

- **Orientation**:
  - Orientation 90 degree
   
- **Indent Level**:
  - Indent Level is 6

- **Text Direction**:
  - Text direction (LeftToRight)
  - Text direction (RightToLeft)
  - Text direction (Context)
```

### Explanation of Alignment Settings

The image displays various alignment settings applied to different cells in an Excel spreadsheet. Each setting is labeled with its respective alignment type (horizontal and vertical alignment) and additional attributes such as indentation and text direction.

- **HAlignFill & VAlignCenter**: Text is aligned to fill the entire cell with a vertical center alignment.
- **HAlignRight & VAlignTop**: Text is right-aligned horizontally and top-aligned vertically.
- **HAlignCenterAcrossSection & VAlignDistributed**: Text is centered across the section with distributed vertical alignment.

### Number Formatting in Excel

The text discusses the importance of number formatting in Excel. It highlights how the same numerical value (e.g., 1.5) can have different meanings depending on the context or format applied. This reinforces the need for appropriate number formatting to ensure clarity and correctness in data representation.

#### Recognized Formats
- **Accounting**: For financial reporting, currencies, etc.
- **Scientific**: For scientific notation and large numerical values.
- **Fractions**: For representing values in fractional form.
- **Currency**: For monetary values with specific formatting.

#### Setting Number Formats
MS Excel provides a dialog box under "Format Cells" where number formats can be set using the "Number" tab. This allows users to apply specific formatting to numbers to meet their display requirements.

## API Reference (if applicable)

None are provided in this section. If applicable, additional API references related to XlsIO for alignment and number formatting would be included here.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

No code examples are present in the provided section. Depending on the context, C# or VB code snippets could be included to demonstrate how to apply alignment and number formatting programmatically using Syncfusion's XlsIO library.

## Number Formatting in XlsIO

XlsIO provides API support for reading and writing the various built-in and custom number formats in a cell by using the **NumberFormat** property of **IRange**. To set the various number formats, use the appropriate typed properties [Number, DateTime, TimeSpan].

The following code example illustrates how to set the format for Number.

### Example Code

```csharp
[C#]

// Applying Number Format.
sheet.Range["C2"].Number = 1000000.00075;
sheet.Range["B2"].Text = "0.00";
sheet.Range["C2"].NumberFormat = "0.00";

sheet.Range["C3"].Number = 1000000.500;
sheet.Range["B3"].Text = "###,##";
sheet.Range["C3"].NumberFormat = "###,##";

sheet.Range["C5"].Number = 10000;
```

Essential XlsIO  
```csharp
sheet.Range[1, 2].Value = "Test";
sheet.Range[1, 3].Value = "=SUM(F1:F10)";
```

You can use these properties in the following way.

- If you have an object, and independent of its type, use Value2.
- If you have a string that can have different data types and do not want to parse it, use Value property.
- When you know the exact data (cell) type, use typed properties.

The following code example illustrates how to get the display text and value in the cell.

```csharp
[C#]

sheet.Range["C4"].Number = 1.20;
sheet.Range["B4"].Text = "$#,##0.00";

Console.Writeline(sheet.Range["C4"].DisplayText);
Console.Writeline(sheet.Range["C4"].Value2.ToString());
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

sheet.Range("C4").Number = 1.20
sheet.Range("B4").Text = "$#,##0.00"

Console.Writeline(sheet.Range("C4").DisplayText)
Console.Writeline(sheet.Range("C4").Value2.ToString())
```

## Color and Pattern Operations

### Getting or Setting the Nearest RGB Color

XlsIO provides the ability to retrieve or set the closest RGB color in the palette using the `SetColorOrGetNearest` method. This method returns the `ColorIndex` value of the color in the Palette that is closest to a given RGBLong color value. The computation of the closest color is performed by treating each RGB color as a point in a 3-dimensional space, with the axes representing the Red, Green, and Blue components. The "closest" color is determined geometrically by calculating the Pythagorean distance (without the square root) between the RGBLong color and each Color in the palette. The `ColorIndex` that minimizes this distance is returned. The distance `Dist` between two colors is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Dist} = (R1 - R2)^2 + (G1 - G2)^2 + (B1 - B2)^2
\]

Where `R1`, `G1`, and `B1` are the components of RGBLong, and `R2`, `G2`, and `B2` are the components of the Color.

### Applying Patterns to Cells

Excel offers various pattern styles for highlighting cells, which can be applied using the `Pattern` tab in the `Format Cells` dialog box. XlsIO also provides APIs to specify these background pattern styles for a cell. The following C# code example demonstrates how to set the pattern type and color for specific cells:

```csharp
// Setting the Pattern Types.
sheet.Range["A2"].CellStyle.FillPattern = ExcelPattern.Angle;
sheet.Range["A4"].CellStyle.FillPattern = ExcelPattern.DarkDownwardDiagonal;

// Setting the Pattern Color.
sheet.Range["A2"].CellStyle.FillBackground = ExcelKnownColors.Aqua;
sheet.Range["A4"].CellStyle.FillBackground = ExcelKnownColors.Pale_blue;
```

## Summary

1. **Color Matching**: XlsIO allows retrieving or setting the nearest RGB color with a `SetColorOrGetNearest` method, using a geometrical distance calculation.
2. **Pattern Application**: Excel pattern styles can be specified for cells using APIs provided by XlsIO.
3. **Example Code**: Demonstrates setting pattern types and colors programmatically.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview

- Provides support for adding and modifying common (or global) styles that can be applied to several ranges of cells in a workbook.
- Usage of global styles is recommended to improve performance when multiple cells require the same formatting.

## Content

### Global Styles

#### 4.1.1.6.1.2 Global Styles

XlsIO provides support for adding and modifying common (or global) styles that can be applied to one or more cells in a workbook. These styles can be created and applied to several ranges of cells in the workbook. Note that the usage of common styles to format spreadsheets is the recommended approach, since setting a separate style for each cell can reduce the performance considerably.

---

**Note:** If you want to apply more than one style for cells, enclose the style within the Begin and End calls. This will improve the performance.

```csharp
// Formatting

// Global styles should be used when the same style needs to be applied to
// more than
// one cell. This usage of a global style reduces memory usage.

// Header Style
IStyle headerStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("HeaderStyle");

// Add custom colors to the palette.
headerStyle.BeginUpdate();
workbook.SetPaletteColor(8, Color.FromArgb(255, 174, 33));
headerStyle.Color = Color.FromArgb(255, 174, 33);
headerStyle.Font.Bold = true;
headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeLeft].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeRight].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeTop].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
headerStyle.Borders[ExcelBordersIndex.EdgeBottom].LineStyle = ExcelLineStyle.Thin;
headerStyle.EndUpdate();

// Body Style
IStyle bodyStyle = workbook.Styles.Add("BodyStyle");

// Add custom colors to the palette.
bodyStyle.BeginUpdate();
```

## Excel 2007 New Formatting Features

### Overview

- Excel 2007 introduces **new formatting** to highlight cells when certain constraints are met.
- Three new visualizations: **Data Bars**, **Color Scales**, and **Icon Sets** help in exploring large datasets, identifying trends and exceptions, and quickly comparing data.

### Data Bars

**Data Bars** allow users to create visual effects to compare values in a dataset by drawing a bar in each cell that represents the value relative to other cells in the selected range.

### How Data Bars Work

Excel compares the values in the selected cells and draws a data bar in each cell to represent the relative value compared to the other cells. This makes it easier for users to identify larger and smaller values in a range.

![Figure 50: Data Bars](https://un Trident 09:10:57Zn.png)

### Setting Data Bar Formats

MS Excel enables setting these formats through the **Conditional Formatting** menu. Users can also set the criteria using the **New Formatting Rule** dialog box.

' Clearing a Range and its formatting.
sheet.Range("A4").Clear(True)
```

## Getting Used Range

XlsIO enables to get the range of cells used in a given sheet. This will help the user to apply the same format to all the cells used in the worksheet. You can also get the first row/column, last row/column, and number of rows/columns used in the sheet, by using the various methods of IRange.

---

**Note:** By default, XlsIO considers a cell as used, even if there exists some formatting. You can disable this behavior, and make XlsIO consider a cell as used, only when there exists data, by using the UsedRangeIncludesFormatting property.

---

Following code example is used to format the Used Range.

```csharp
// Modifying only the Used Ranges.
sheet.UsedRange.ColumnWidth = 20;
sheet.UsedRange.RowHeight = 20;
```

```vbnet
' Modifying only the Used Ranges.
sheet.UsedRange.ColumnWidth = 20
sheet.UsedRange.RowHeight = 20
```

### 4.1.2.2 Find and Replace

Find and Replace feature in Excel enables to navigate between large spreadsheets. It carries out a simultaneous search in Microsoft Excel values, formulas, and also comments.

XlsIO also has support for finding and replacing contents in a worksheet. It has various options to find the first matching entry, find all the matching entries, and replace the found content with various data and data sources.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to create and format charts in Excel using Series.
- Explains the process of adding data series and setting colors for the chart plot area and individual series.

## Content

### Chart Formatting and Series Example

#### Code Example: Setting Gradient Fill and Series Formatting
The following code snippet sets up a chart with a gradient fill and formats individual data series with different colors.

```csharp
chartPlotArea.Fill.FillType = ExcelFillType.Gradient

' Two Color
chartPlotArea.Fill.GradientColorType = ExcelGradientColor.TwoColor

' Set two colors.
chartPlotArea.Fill.BackColor = Color.FromArgb(205, 217, 234)
chartPlotArea.Fill.ForeColor = Color.White

' Format Data Series.
Dim chartAppleSerie As IChartSerie = chart.Series("Apples")

' Color of first serie.
chartAppleSerie.SerieFormat.AreaProperties.ForeColor = Color.Red
chartAppleSerie = chart.Series("Oranges")

' Color of second serie.
chartAppleSerie.SerieFormat.AreaProperties.ForeColor = Color.Orange
chartAppleSerie = chart.Series("Grapes")

' Color of third serie.
chartAppleSerie.SerieFormat.AreaProperties.ForeColor = Color.Purple
chartAppleSerie = chart.Series("Banana")

' Color of fourth serie.
chartAppleSerie.SerieFormat.AreaProperties.ForeColor = Color.Yellow

' Embedded chart position.
chart.TopRow = 10
chart.BottomRow = 40
chart.LeftColumn = 5
chart.RightColumn = 15
```

#### Explanation
- **Gradient Fill Setup**: The chart plot area is configured with a two-color gradient where the background color is set to a light gray `(205, 217, 234)` and the foreground color is white.
- **Series Color Formatting**: Individual data series ("Apples", "Oranges", "Grapes", "Banana") are accessed and their fill colors are set to red, orange, purple, and yellow, respectively.
- **Chart Position**: The chart is embedded in the worksheet, positioned between rows 10 and 40, and columns 5 to 15.

### Inserting Data for the Chart
The following code example shows how to insert sample data for the chart into an Excel sheet.

```csharp
[C#]

// Inserting sample data for the chart.
sheet.Range["A1"].Text = "Month";
sheet.Range["B1"].Text = "Product A";
sheet.Range["C1"].Text = "Product B";

// Months
sheet.Range["A2"].Text = "Jan";
```

#### Explanation
- **Data Header Setup**: Headers for the columns are added to cells A1, B1, and C1, representing "Month", "Product A", and "Product B", respectively.
- **Inserting Data**: The month "Jan" is entered into cell A2 as the first data point.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates the use of hyperlinks in XlsIO.
- Explains how to add header/footer to print sheets in MS Excel.

## Content

### 4.2.4 Header/Footer

#### Overview
Often, there is a need to include some information about your document at the top (the header), or the bottom (the footer) of each printed sheet. Spreadsheets often need several pages to print. It is important to put the right information on the header or footer, so you can tell which pages go together.

![Figure 85: XlsIO with Hyperlinks](https://placeholder.com/image.png)

#### Key Points
- Headers and footers provide crucial information for printed sheets.
- MS Excel offers an option to insert headers and footers through the **View** menu and a handy dialog box.

#### Instructions
- **Process**: 
  1. Access the **View** menu.
  2. Locate and select the option to insert headers and footers.
  3. Use the dialog box provided to customize header/footer content.

## Code Examples

### Sample Code for Adding Headers and Footers
```csharp
// Import necessary namespaces
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;

// Initialize workbook
IWorkbook workbook = new Workbook();
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Add header/footer
sheet.BuiltInHeadersFooters.AddHeaderFooter("&C &D", BuiltInHeaderFooterSection.Header);
sheet.BuiltInHeadersFooters.AddHeaderFooter("&L &P/&N", BuiltInHeaderFooterSection.Footer);

// Save workbook
workbook.Save("DocumentWithHeadersFooters.xlsx");
// Dispose objects
workbook.Dispose();
```

## Show/Hide Collapse Button

You can also show/hide the **Collapse** button that appears in the fields of the pivot table, when there exists more than one item in a field. The following code example illustrates how to do this.

```csharp
pivotTable.ShowDrillIndicators = true;
```

### Display Field Caption and Filter Option

It is also possible to show/hide the **Filter** button and field name in the pivot table by using the PivotTable Options dialog box in Excel. This is illustrated in the following code.

```csharp
pivotTable.DisplayFieldCaptions = true;
```

- The process involves selecting the data range, modifying the range if necessary, and choosing the position for the PivotChart within the workbook.

## Content

### Figure Description

#### Figure 93: PivotChart Creation Dialog Box

The screenshot shows the **Create PivotTable with PivotChart** dialog box in Excel, where users can specify the data range for analysis and choose where to place the PivotTable and PivotChart. The key elements are:

- **Select the data that you want to analyze:**
  - The selected range is `Data!$A$1:$H$50`, and users can modify this if needed.
  - The option to use an external data source is also available but not selected.

- **Choose where you want the PivotTable and PivotChart to be placed:**
  - The default option is to place them in a **New Worksheet**, which is commonly used for PivotCharts.

#### Figure 94: New Sheet to Place the PivotTable and PivotChart

The second screenshot shows the setup for a **New Sheet** to hold the PivotTable and PivotChart. Key elements include:

  - The green checkbox in the PivotField area indicates that fields are being selected for the PivotTable and PivotChart.

- **Chart 1:**
  - The chart is visually displayed with a sample bar chart.
  - Instructions guide users to build the PivotChart by choosing fields from the PivotTable Field List.

### Explanation

- By default, MS Excel selects the entire range of data in the table. Users can modify the range if specific data needs to be analyzed.
- The PivotChart is typically placed in a **New Worksheet**, making it easier to view and analyze without cluttering the original data sheet.

## WinForms-specific conventions
- The document uses Excel-specific terminology and features, such as PivotTables and PivotCharts, which are relevant for data analysis and visualization tasks in WinForms applications.

## API Reference (if applicable)
No specific APIs are referenced in this section, as the focus is on Excel functionality. However, similar data handling and pivot functionalities can be implemented in C# for WinForms applications using libraries such as `ExcelInterOp`.

### 4.2.9 OLE Objects

#### Overview of OLE Objects

**Object Linking and Embedding (OLE):**

Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is one of the most widely used methods for inserting data into Microsoft Office documents. Although embedding or linking objects increases the size of the original document, it enhances document readability by providing offline access to content. Before reading the content of the object, the associated software must be installed in the machine. For example, to read a PDF file linked or embedded in an Excel document, Adobe Reader is required.

Essential XlsIO provides read and write support for OLE Objects in XLSX format. These objects can be linked or embedded in Excel documents using the `I OleObject` interface.

#### Note on Platform Support

**Note:** Currently, the read and write functions for OLE Objects are supported in Windows, ASP.NET, and WPF platforms only.

## API Reference

### Namespaces and Classes

- **Namespace:** Syncfusion.XlsIO
- **Class:** OleDb
- **Interface:** `I OleDbObject`

#### Parameters and Methods

- Use `I OleDbObject` for reading and writing OLE Objects.
- Ensure the associated software is installed for linked or embedded OLE Objects.

## Code Examples

### Example: Embedding an OLE Object

```csharp
// Embedding an OLE Object
using (var excelEngine = new ExcelEngine())
{
    var workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Create(1);
    IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

    // Add OLE object
    I OleObject oleObject = worksheet.OleObjects.Add("Excel.Sheet.12", 10, 10, "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Document.xlsx");

    // Save and dispose
    workbook.SaveAs("EmbeddedOLEObject.xlsx");
    workbook.Close();
}

excelEngine.Dispose();
```

### Setting Printing Range

#### Print Titles

MS Excel provides an option to repeat rows and columns, so that the labels will be displayed on every page that it takes to print the sheet. This can be selected through the Sheet tab of the Page Setup dialog box.

XlsIO allows setting these titles through the APIs discussed in the following code.

```csharp
[!#csharp]

// Sets printing range
sheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = "$G$7:$K$9,$G$11,$H$12,$I$13,$J$14";
```

```vb.net
[!#VB.NET]

' Sets printing range
sheet.PageSetup.PrintArea = "$G$7:$K$9,$G$11,$H$12,$I$13,$J$14";
```

### Print Options

There are other settings that can be used to customize the Print options. They are as follows.

#### Grid Lines

These are the gray lines that separate the cells. Checking the box will enable them to print. These can be enabled/disabled through XlsIO by using the `PrintGridlines` property of `IPageSetup` interface.

### Headings

- **Print Titles:**
  - Allows repeating rows and columns (titles) on every printed page.
- **Printing Range:**
  - Setting specific areas for printing through APIs.
- **Print Options:**
  - Customizing print settings like grid lines and headings.

## Content

### Setting Formulas in Worksheet Cells

The following code snippet demonstrates how to set predefined formulas in different cells of a worksheet. Each cell contains a specific Excel function or formula.

```csharp
sheet.Range["A91"].Text = "MODE(A3:A4)";
sheet.Range["B91"].Formula = "MODE(A3:A4)";

sheet.Range["A92"].Text = "NEGBINOMDIST(A3,A4,A8)";
sheet.Range["B92"].Formula = "NEGBINOMDIST(A3,A4,A8)";

sheet.Range["A93"].Text = "NORMINV(A8,A4,A5)";
sheet.Range["B93"].Formula = "NORMINV(A8,A4,A5)";

sheet.Range["A94"].Text = "NORMSINV(A8)";
sheet.Range["B94"].Formula = "NORMSINV(A8)";

sheet.Range["A95"].Text = "NPER(A3,A4,A5)";
sheet.Range["B95"].Formula = "NPER(A3,A4,A5)";

sheet.Range["A96"].Text = "NPV(A3,A4)";
sheet.Range["B96"].Formula = "NPV(A3,A4)";

sheet.Range["A97"].Text = "PEARSON(A3:A8,A13:A18)";
sheet.Range["B97"].Formula = "PEARSON(A3:A8,A13:A18)";

sheet.Range["A98"].Text = "PERCENTILE(A3:A8,A18)";
sheet.Range["B98"].Formula = "PERCENTILE(A3:A8,A18)";

sheet.Range["A99"].Text = "PERCENTRANK(A3:A8,A3)";
sheet.Range["B99"].Formula = "PERCENTRANK(A3:A8,A3)";

sheet.Range["A100"].Text = "PERMUT(A3,2)";
sheet.Range["B100"].Formula = "PERMUT(A3,2)";

sheet.Range["A101"].Text = "PMT(A3,A4,A5)";
sheet.Range["B101"].Formula = "PMT(A3,A4,A5)";

sheet.Range["A102"].Text = "PPMT(A8,A4,A5,A6)";
sheet.Range["B102"].Formula = "PPMT(A8,A4,A5,A6)";

sheet.Range["A103"].Text = "PROB(A3:A4,A8:A18,A3)";
sheet.Range["B103"].Formula = "PROB(A3:A4,A8:A18,A3)";

sheet.Range["A104"].Text = "PRODUCT({150,2,3,4,5,20})";
sheet.Range["B104"].Formula = "PRODUCT({150,2,3,4,5,20})";

sheet.Range["A105"].Text = "PV(A3,A4,A5)";
sheet.Range["B105"].Formula = "PV(A3,A4,A5)";

sheet.Range["A106"].Text = "QUARTILE(A3:A7,A8)";
```

Each formula is assigned to both a cell's text (for display) and formula (for computation).

## Notes
- Ensure that the referenced cells (e.g., A3, A4) contain valid data for accurate calculations.
- The `Formula` property expects valid Excel functions with correct syntax.

## Cross References
- Refer to the Excel documentation for detailed descriptions of each function used in the code.

## Accessing and Working with Formulas Across Worksheets

Essential Xlsl0

```csharp
workbook.SetSeparators(";", ",", "")
```

- In addition to being able to access values in the same worksheet, you can also access values across worksheets. Assume that the "B" is present on the second worksheet, then use the following code for calculation.

**[C#]**
```csharp
sheet.Range["C2:C4"].Formula = "=SUM(Sheet2!B2:B4,Sheet1!A2:A4)";
```

- Sheet1 and Sheet2 are the default names of the worksheets.

**[VB.NET]**
```vb.net
sheet.Range("C2:C4").Formula = "=SUM(sheet2!B2:B4,sheet1!A2:A4)"
```

### Reading Formula Text and Computed Values

You can also read the Formula Text and the Computed Value of the formula in the cell.

Following code example illustrates how to read the formulas and computed values.

**[C#]**
```csharp
// Read computed Formula Value.
this.txtFomulaNumber.Text = sheet.Range["C1"].FormulaNumberValue.ToString();

// Read Formula.
this.txtFormula.Text = sheet.Range["C1"].Formula;
```

**[VB.NET]**
```vb.net
' Read computed Formula Value.
Me.txtFomulaNumber.Text = sheet.Range("C1").FormulaNumberValue.ToString()

' Read Formula.
Me.txtFormula.Text = sheet.Range("C1").Formula
```

### Retrieving Formula Values

You can also get the Formula values as bool, date, and number type. Note that XlsIO can only read already computed formulas, and cannot compute. Please refer to the [Calculation Engine] for more information on dynamic formula computation.

### Using IRange Interface for Formulas

Following properties of the IRange interface are used to fetch formulas, computed values, and to check if there exists a formula in the cell.

- Illustrates how to disable and enable sheet formula calculations.
- Sample code demonstrating formula evaluation and computation using Essential XlsIO, ensuring compatibility with MS Excel.

## Content

### Disabling Sheet Formula Calculations

Essential XlsIO allows you to disable the calculations of Essential Calculate supported formulas that are added at runtime to the worksheet. The following code sample illustrates how to disable the sheet formula calculations.

```csharp
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
// Formula calculation is enabled for the sheet.
sheet.DisableSheetCalculations();
```

### Enabling and Evaluating Sheet Formula Calculations

Here are some code samples to evaluate some formulas entered by using Essential XlsIO during runtime. The XlsIO computed value is identical to the values computed by using MS Excel.

```csharp
[C#]

// Inserting sample text into the first cell of the first worksheet.
sheet.Range["A1"].Number = 10.99;
sheet.Range["B1"].Number = 10;
sheet.Range["C1"].Formula = "A1+B1";
sheet.Range["D1"].Formula = "AVERAGE(A1:B1)";

// Formula calculation is enabled for the sheet.
sheet.EnableSheetCalculations();

Console.WriteLine(sheet.Range["C1"].CalculatedValue.ToString(), sheet.Range["C1"].Formula);
Console.WriteLine(sheet.Range["D1"].CalculatedValue.ToString(), sheet.Range["D1"].Formula);

// Add more data
sheet.Range["A2"].Number = 11.99;
sheet.Range["B2"].Number = 11;
sheet.Range["C2"].Formula = "A2+B2";
sheet.Range["D2"].Formula = "AVERAGE(A2:B2)";

Console.WriteLine(sheet.Range["C2"].CalculatedValue.ToString(), sheet.Range["C2"].Formula);
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Disabling and Enabling Calculations**: The `DisableSheetCalculations()` and `EnableSheetCalculations()` methods manage the activation of formula calculations on the worksheet.
- **Formula Input**: Formulas like `=A1+B1` and `=AVERAGE(A1:B1)` are assigned to specific cells.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Describes the process of inserting defined names using the Insert menu in Excel.
- Explains how to define a name and its reference in a workbook.
- Illustrates creating named ranges programmatically through the XlsIO interface using C#.

## Content

### Inserting Defined Names using Insert Menu

#### Figure: Inserting Defined Names using Insert Menu

![Figure 123: Inserting Defined Names using Insert Menu](https://example.com/figure123.png)

**Figure 123: Inserting Defined Names using Insert Menu**

To insert defined names in an Excel workbook using the Insert menu, follow these steps:

1. Open the Excel worksheet.
2. Go to the **Insert** menu.
3. Select **Name** > **Define**.

This action will open the **Define Name** dialog box.

#### Define Name Dialog Box

![Figure 124: Define Name Dialog Box](https://example.com/figure124.png)

**Figure 124: Define Name Dialog Box**

In the **Define Name** dialog box:

- **Names in workbook**: Lists all defined names in the workbook.
- **Refers to**: Specifies the cell or range of cells that the defined name refers to.

For example, a named range can be created to refer to a specific cell, like `=Sheet1!$A$3`.

### Creating Named Ranges Programmatically

You can create named ranges in spreadsheets through XlsIO with the `IName` interface. The range for the name is specified through the `RefersToRange` property, from which you can access the Range text and other information. This can be specified for workbooks and worksheets.

#### Code Example

The following C# code example illustrates how to create named ranges and use them in formulas.

```csharp
[IName]
```

### Explanation

The `RefersToRange` property allows you to specify the range or cell that the named range refers to. This named range can then be used in formulas or other parts of your Excel workbook programmatically.

#### Example Usage

To assign a named range (`name1`) that points to cell `A3` on `Sheet1`:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
IName name = sheet.Names.Add("name1", sheet.Cells["A3"].ReferenceText);
```

This example creates a named range called `name1` that refers to the range `A3` on the first worksheet.

### API Reference

- **IName** interface: Used for defining named ranges in Excel.
- **RefersToRange** property: Specifies the range or cell reference for the named range.

## Code Examples

### C#

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
IName name = sheet.Names.Add("name1", sheet.Cells["A3"].ReferenceText);
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to sort a range of cells dynamically during runtime.
- Explains the process with code samples.
- Focuses on sorting the column 'ID' in descending order in a sample Excel document.

## Content

### 4.5.3.2 Sorting Data by Cell Values

This section is used to sort a range of cells dynamically, at runtime. This is explained in the following code samples:

**Figure: Sorting Example in Excel**
![](output.xlsx - Microsoft Excel)

The image shows an Excel spreadsheet titled "output.xlsx" where the column "ID" is sorted in descending order. The spreadsheet contains the following columns and data:

- **Column Titles**
  - ID
  - Name
  - DOJ (Date of Joining)
  - Salary

- **Sorted Data**
  - ID: 59653 → 28785
  - Names: Francisco Chang, Yoshi Tannamuri, José Pedro Freyre, etc.
  - DOJ: Various dates from 1/14/2001 to 10/3/2012.
  - Salary: Various amounts from $7,677.00 to $55,078.00.

Column "ID" is Sorted in Descending order.

### Implementation Details

The sorting functionality is demonstrated in the context of a C# application, as part of a larger application or library, likely utilizing Syncfusion's XlsIO component. The focus is on dynamically sorting a specific column in an Excel worksheet.

## Code Examples

```csharp
// (Code example not explicitly provided here)
// The implementation would likely involve:
// 1. Opening an existing Excel workbook or creating a new one.
// 2. Selecting the specific range or column to be sorted.
// 3. Applying the sorting functionality, either ascending or descending, on the specified column.
// An example could look like this:

// Step 1: Create or open an Excel document
IApplication application = new Application();
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("input.xlsx");

// Step 2: Access the specific worksheet
IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Step 3: Sort the column
worksheet.Range["A4:H26"].SortAscending("A4:A26", true);

// Step 4: Save or close the workbook
workbook.SaveAs("output.xlsx");
workbook.Close();
application.Quit();
```

# Essential XlsIO

```vb
'Creates the Data sorter
Dim sorter As IDataSort = book.CreateDataSorter()
'Specifies the sort range.
sorter.SortRange = range

Dim field As ISortField
' Adds the sort field with column index, sort based on and order by attribute
field = sorter.SortFields.Add(2, SortOn.CellColor, OrderBy.OnTop)
'Sorts the data based on this color
field.Color = Color.Red
' Sorts the data with the sort field attribute
sorter.Sort()
```

## 4.5.4 Import/Export

XlsIO has some helper methods that enable working with the ADO.NET data sources very easily.

### Importing

It only takes one line of code to import an ADO.NET data table into a worksheet. There are similar methods for working with other data sources like Data View, Data Column, Arrays, and so on. A data table from another source can be imported inside a worksheet by using the `ImportDataTable` method. It has an option to select the record range (row start, row end, col start and col end). It also allows preserving the data type in the data source.

### Exporting

Similarly, it is simple to export the sheet data to a data table by using the `ExportDataTable` method of IWorksheet. This method allows to select the various data table options such as include column names, export formula calculated values, styles and types, through the `ExcelExportDataTableOption` enumeration. It has the following values.

---

### Code Implementation
The following C# code snippet demonstrates the definition of a `Sales` class that integrates with the Excel template using the marker argument.

```csharp
[C#]
//Definition of the business objects with the marker argument
class Sales
{
    private string m_salesPerson;
    private int m_sold;

    public string SalesPerson
    {
        get
        {
            return m_salesPerson;
        }
        set
        {
            m_salesPerson = value;
        }
    }

    [TemplateMarkerAttributes("Sold", "$#,###")]
    public int Sold
    {
        get
        {
            return m_sold;
        }
        set
        {
            m_sold = value;
        }
    }

    public Sales()
    {
    }

    public Sales(string name, int sold)
    {
        this.m_salesPerson = name;
        this.m_sold = sold;
    }
}
```

- **Properties**:
  - `SalesPerson`: A public string property that holds the name of the salesperson.
  - `Sold`: A public integer property that represents the sales amount, formatted as `"$#,###"` using the `TemplateMarkerAttributes` attribute.

- **Constructors**:
  - A default constructor is provided for basic initialization.
  - A parameterized constructor `Sales(string name, int sold)` initializes the object with the salesperson's name and sales amount.

## API Reference

### TemplateMarkerAttributes
- **Description**: Specifies how the attribute values of the property bind with the corresponding header. This is particularly useful for formatting data as it is inserted into the Excel template.

## Code Examples

The provided C# code snippet shows how the `Sales` class can be instantiated and used with Excel templates. The class allows for easy data insertion into Excel sheets, leveraging markers for both data placement and styling.

# Essential XlsIO

This is another variant of the Template based approach, but the difference is that the end-user places special markers in the template spreadsheet, which gets replaced along with the data during runtime. The main advantage of this approach is that the end-user gets the flexibility of designing the Excel report.

Cells in the worksheet can be filled with single data or with multiple records. Format of these data can be changed by using the arguments of the markers.

## Marker Syntax

Each marker starts with some prefix, by default it is "%" character, and followed by the variable name and properties. There could be several arguments after the variable, which are delimited by some character, by default it is semicolon (;).

![Template Marker](https://i.imgur.com/figur.png)
**Figure 135: Template Marker**

## Source

XlsIO can be used to bind various data sources to these markers. This includes data sources such as Data Table, Data Set, Data Reader, Data View, Array, Variable and Formulas.

## Arguments

You can specify the following arguments in the marker to customize the worksheet.

- Horizontal-This argument specifies the horizontal direction of the data import for complex variables.
- Vertical-This argument specifies the vertical direction of the data import for complex variables.
- Insert-This argument inserts new rows or columns, depending on the direction argument for each new cell. Note that by default, the rows cannot be added.
- insert:copystyles-This argument copies styles from the above row or left column.
- jump:[cell reference in R1C1 notation]-This argument binds the data to the cell at the specified reference. Cell reference addresses can be relative or absolute.
- copyrange:[top-left cell reference in R1C1]:[bottom-right cell reference in R1C1]-Copies the specified cells after each cell import.

Here is the sample after dynamically filling the data during runtime.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- This page describes how to group and ungroup rows and columns in Excel using the `Group` and `Ungroup` methods provided by the `IRange` interface in Essential XlsIO.
- It includes examples demonstrating how to group by rows and columns, and how to expand or collapse groups.

## Content

### Grouping and Ungrouping in Essential XlsIO

Essential XlsIO provides support to group and ungroup rows and columns by using the `Group` and `Ungroup` methods of `IRange`. You can also collapse or expand groups through one of its overloads.

#### Figure: Grouping from Data Menu
![Grouping from Data Menu](https://i.imgur.com/G387.png)

**Figure 137: Grouping from Data Menu**

Understanding how to effectively manage your data by grouping and ungrouping rows and columns is crucial for data organization and presentation in Excel. Here's how you can perform these operations using Essential XlsIO in C#:

---

#### Code Examples

```csharp
// Grouping by Rows.
sheet.Range["A1:A3"].Group(ExcelGroupBy.ByRows, true);
sheet.Range["A4:A6"].Group(ExcelGroupBy.ByRows);

// Grouping by Columns.
sheet.Range["A1:B1"].Group(ExcelGroupBy.ByColumns, true);
sheet.Range["C1:F1"].Group(ExcelGroupBy.ByColumns);

// Ungroup by Rows
sheet.Range["A1:A3"].Ungroup(ExcelGroupBy.ByRows);
```

### Detailed Explanation
- **Grouping Rows**: The first two lines demonstrate how to group rows in the range `A1:A3`. The `true` parameter indicates that the group should be collapsed initially.
- **Grouping Columns**: Similarly, the next two lines show grouping of columns in the ranges `A1:B1` and `C1:F1`. The `true` parameter here also specifies collapsing the columns initially.
- **Ungrouping**: The last line shows how to ungroup the rows in the range `A1:A3`.

This functionality is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, allowing for better organization and selective visibility of data subsets.

## 5.1.7 How to open an existing Xlsx workbook and save it as Xlsx?

You can open and save an existing Excel 2007 file to the `.xlsx` format by using XlsIO. The following code example illustrates how to do this.

```csharp
[C#]

// Open an existing Excel 2007 file.
IWorkbook workbook =
excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open(@"..\\..\\Data\\Excel2007.xlsx",
ExcelOpenType.Automatic);

// Select the version to be saved.
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007;

// Save it as "Excel 2007" format.
workbook.SaveAs("Sample.xlsx");
```

```vbnet
[VB.NET]

' Open an existing Excel 2007 file.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook =
excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("..\\..\\Data\\Excel2007.xlsx",
ExcelOpenType.Automatic)

' Select the version to be saved.
workbook.Version = ExcelVersion.Excel2007

For more information, see [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HA100778231033.aspx](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/HA100778231033.aspx).

## 5.1.15 How to use Named Ranges with XlsIO?

The `NamedRanges` collection belongs to the workbook and not to the worksheet. If you define two named ranges with the same name, the named range that is defined last will replace the previous named range.

```csharp
// Looping through the Named Ranges in a spreadsheet.
foreach (INamedRange name in mySheet.Names)
{
    MessageBox.Show(name.Name.ToString());
}

// There is already a named range called "One", I am changing the address that it points to.
mySheet.Names["One"].RefersTo = mySheet.Range["B6"];

// Named ranges are added to the workbook collection in both the methods mentioned below.
// Adding the named Range to the workbook.
myWorkbook.Names.Add("TestRangeBook", mySheet.Range["A5"]);

// Adding the named Range to the workbook. Internally named range is added to the workbook names collection.
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Essential XlsIO provides data binding functionality from various data sources.
- Supports data binding using data sources, variables, variable arrays, and formulas.
- Various arguments can be used with markers for controlling data import formatting.

## Content

### Data Source

This includes data tables, datasets, data readers, and data views. A data source can be used to bind a large number of records to the template document. This will add the rows for each record, and the fields to be bound are identified through the field name in the template.

**Syntax:** `%DataSource.FieldName`

### Variable Name

This option allows you to bind a single data value stored in a variable to the marker in the template.

**Syntax:** `%VariableName`

### Variable Array

This option allows you to bind an array of data stored in an array to the marker in the template.

**Syntax:** `%VariableArray`

### Formulas

This option allows you to create formulas for each row when multiple records comprising formula in the cells are bound to the marker. If a cell contains a formula, by default it will be stretched to the rows/columns for any of the above sources of data binding.

#### Figure: Formulas
![Formulas](image.png)

### What are the Various Arguments for the Marker?

The following arguments can be used with the marker to control the formatting while binding the data:

- **Horizontal:** This argument specifies the horizontal direction of the data import for complex variables.
- **Vertical:** This argument specifies the vertical direction of the data import for complex variables.
- **Insert:** This argument inserts new rows or columns depending on the direction argument for each new cell. By default, the rows cannot be added.
- **insert:copystyles:** This argument copies the style from the row above or the left column.

- Keep full signatures, imports/usings, comments, region markers.
- Inline code in text should be wrapped with backticks.

### Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

- If the body contains a local Table of Contents for this page, keep it as a bullet/numbered list with links/text as shown. Do not create links that don’t exist.
- Ignore global site TOC or breadcrumbs unless the page explicitly describes them.

### Cross References

- Add See also: bullet list of explicit links/texts present on the page. Do not fabricate.

### RAG Annotations

- At the end, add an HTML comment with tags and keywords derived ONLY from visible content:
  <!-- tags: [product, module, control, api, version?] keywords: [k1, k2, ...] -->
- Add optional per-section anchors as HTML comments before each H2/H3 to aid chunking, using IDs derived from the heading (kebab-case), e.g., <!-- anchor: XlsIO#page_439#getting-started -->. Do not add if the heading text is unclear.

- If working with XML, MDB, or other data files, ensure they have sufficient security permissions.
- Authenticated users should have full control over files and directories to allow ASP.NET code to open files at runtime.

#### JavaScript Files in ASPX Page
- The following JavaScript files should be added in the ASPX page:
  - `jquery-1.3.2.min.js`
  - `MicrosoftAjax.js`

#### Adding JavaScript Files
The above-mentioned script files are added by using the following code:

```html
<script src="<%= Url.Content("~/Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js") %>" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="<%= Url.Content("~/Scripts/MicrosoftAjax.js") %>" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

#### Deployment Completion
With this step, the process of deploying XlsIO in the ASP.NET application gets completed.

ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
```

```vbnet
' New instance of XlsIO is created. [Equivalent to launching MS Excel with
' no workbooks open].
' The instantiation process consists of two steps.

' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
Dim excelEngine As ExcelEngine = New ExcelEngine()
```

4. Instantiate the Excel application through the `IApplication` interface which represents an Excel application.

```csharp
// Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
```

```vbnet
' Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
```

An Excel document is created.

5. Create a workbook. A newly created workbook has three worksheets by default. You can change the count of the worksheets by using the `Create` method of `IWorkbook`.

```csharp
// A new workbook is created. [Equivalent to creating a new workbook in MS Excel].
// The new workbook will have 5 worksheets.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create(5);
```

## Overview
- Discusses scenarios where Syncfusion Assemblies are used in XlsIO under different trust levels.
- Highlights the usage of specific assemblies for XlsIO in medium trust environments.
- Provides a summary of key features of Essential XlsIO.

## Content

### Trust Scenarios with Syncfusion Assemblies

#### Example 1
If the Syncfusion Assemblies are in the **GAC (Global Assembly Cache)**, and the **Web Application** is running in **medium trust**, then the Syncfusion assemblies actually run in **full trust**. Hence, this scenario is fully supported and there are no additional steps necessary for deployment.

#### Example 2
Say, the Syncfusion Assemblies are present in the application's **bin** folder and the **Web Application** is running in **medium trust**, then the Syncfusion assemblies will run in **medium trust**.

You have to use the following assemblies instead of **XlsIO.Base** to work with XlsIO in medium trust level:

- **Syncfusion.Core.dll**
- **Syncfusion.Compression.Base.dll**
- **Syncfusion.XlsIO.Web.dll**

No additional changes are required, except the assembly references.

## Reducing size of Excel 2007 & Excel 2010 files

### Overview
- The default compression technique, using .NET compression, is replaced with a new technique to reduce the size of XLSX files.
- The reduced file size leads to decreased data transfer between applications.
- The Compression level can be set at the IApplication interface to apply to all workbooks created using the same instance of Excel Engine.

### Content

#### 3.7.2.1 Reducing size of Excel 2007 & Excel 2010 files

The default compression technique, using which Essential XlsIO compresses files uses .NET compression. A new compression technique has been implemented that will considerably reduce the size of the compressed XLSX files.

##### Use Case Scenarios

The reduced size of the compressed file will result in reduced data transfer between applications.

##### How Compression level can be set

The Compression level can be set at IApplication interface. This will set the level for all the workbooks created using the same instance of Excel Engine.

##### C# Code Example

```csharp
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2007; // or ExcelVersion.Excel2010;
application.CompressionLevel = Syncfusion.Compression.CompressionLevel.Best;

workbook.SaveAs(fileName);

# Essential XlsIO

Dim workbook As IWorkbook =excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open("spreadsheetml", ExcelXmlOpenType.MExcel)

'The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

'Write data
sheet.Range("C3:O28").Text = "Hello world"

'Save as SpreadsheetML.
workbook.SaveAsXml("Sample.xml",ExcelXmlSaveType.MExcel)

### Note: Currently XlsIO cannot parse the Document Properties apart from elements that are not supported by MS Excel. Colors created by XlsIO will choose the closest color to it when exported to the SpreadsheetML format. For more information refer Excel 97 to 2003, Excel 2007 [Xlsx-Biff12 format], and CSV format.

## 3.7.4 CSV Format

The Comma Separated Value (CSV) file format is a file type that stores tabular data. The CSV file format is often used to exchange data between disparate applications. The file format, as it is used in Microsoft Excel, has become a pseudo standard throughout the industry, even among non-Microsoft platforms.

XlsIO provides support for reading and writing CSV files. The following code example illustrates how to open a .csv file.

[C#]

// Opening a File.
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("CSVfile.csv", ",");

[VB.NET]

' Opening a File.
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Open("CSVfile.csv", ",")

While saving files, you have options to save as Unicode, ASCII, and other Non-Unicode encoding. The following code example illustrates how to save a file to the CSV format.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Describes the number formatting options in Excel.
- Explains how to format long numbers, hide zeros, and manage leading zeros.

## Content

### Number Formatting in Excel

#### Figure: Number Formatting in Excel

![Figure 38: Number formatting in Excel](https://example.com/figure38)

A number format consists of up to 4 items, separated by semicolons. Each of the items is an individual number format. The first, by default, applies to positive numbers, the second to negative numbers, the third to zeros, and the fourth to text. If you don't apply any special formatting to text, Excel uses the 'General' number format, which basically means anything that will fit.

---

### Long Numbers

You can make long numbers easier to read by inserting a thousands separator (a comma for US regional settings). The `#, ##0` number format is used. This format does not allow Excel to use the shorter scientific format, so the longest numbers merely show `########`, signifying that they don't fit in their cells. You can either **auto fit** the column or specify the column width in order to avoid showing `########`.

---

### Hide Zeros

Excel allows to hide zero values from displaying, when the user is not interested to show the values if it is "0". This can be done by setting custom format as **General** or **0.00**.

#### Figure: XlsIO with Number Formatting

The figure below illustrates different number formats applied to various data values and their resulting display formats in an Excel sheet. The table below lists the data, the applied number format, and the final result:

| Data                     | Number Format Applied | Result                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1000000.00075           | 0.00                  | 1000000.00                      |
| 1000000.500             | ###,###               | 1,000,001                       |
| 1.20                    | $#,##0.00            | $1.20                           |
| 10000                   | 0.00                  | 10000.00                        |
| -500                    | [Blue]#,###0         | -500                            |
| 0.000000000000000001234567890 | [Blue]#,###0 | 0.000000000000000001234567890 |
| 1.20                    | 0.00%                | 120.00%                         |
| 1.20                    | 0.00E+00             | 1.20E+00                        |

The sample Excel sheet is shown in the image below:

![XlsIO with Number Formatting](attachment://Figure_39.png)

#### Explanation of Border Settings

Microsoft Excel allows you to customize the appearance of cell borders to enhance data visibility and organization. You can adjust border styles, line weights, and colors to suit your needs. This can be particularly useful for highlighting specific rows or columns, or for creating visual groupings within a worksheet. The options for border customization are accessible through the Formatting toolbar or the Border tab in the Format Cells dialog box, providing a flexible way to manage the visual presentation of your data.

### Figure: XlsIO with Number Formatting Explained

The figure shows how various number formats affect the presentation of data in an Excel sheet. Each row demonstrates a different number format applied to a specific value, resulting in a transformed display format. This allows users to present numerical data in a way that is not only precise but also visually intuitive and easy to understand.

## 4.1.1.5 Fill Settings

This section illustrates the fill settings available in Excel.

### Color

MS Excel provides support to format its cells, rows, and columns with various colors and patterns. This can be done by using the **Fill Color** button and an associated palette.

![Figure 42: Format Cells Dialog Box](https://via.placeholder.com/600)

A color is a 4-byte number of the format `00BBGGRR`, where `RR`, `GG`, and `BB` values are the Red, Green, and Blue values, each of which is between 0 and 255 (`&HFF`). If all component values are 0, the RGB color is 0, which is black. If all component values are 255 (`&HFF`), the RGB color is `16,777,215` (`&H00FFFFFF`), or white. All other color combinations of values for the red, green, and blue components.

## Conditional Formatting Using Data Bars in XlsIO

### Overview
- Configure cell formatting based on value ranges.
- Utilize conditional formatting rules to visually emphasize data ranges.
- Implement data bars to represent the relative size of cell values.

## Content

### Conditional Formatting Rule Setup

#### New Formatting Rule Dialog
Figure 51 illustrates the setup for applying conditional formatting rules in Excel.

**Figure 51: New Formatting Rule Dialog for setting Data Bar**

The dialog allows users to:

1. **Select a Rule Type**: Choose from various formatting options based on cell values, such as formatting all cells based on their values, cells containing specific values, or unique/duplicate values.
2. **Edit the Rule Description**: Define how the rule should format the cells, using features such as Data Bars to visually represent the relative size of the cell values.

#### Key Components in the Dialog
- **Format Style**: Options to select Data Bars or other styles.
- **Show Bar Only**: Option to display only the bar, without the original cell values.
- **Bar Color**: Select a color for the data bars.
- **Preview**: Provides a preview of how the data bars will appear.

### Color Scales

#### Description
**Color Scales** enable the creation of visual effects in Excel data, allowing users to compare the value of a cell with the values in a specified range of cells.

- **Functionality**: Color scales use cell shading to communicate relative values.
- **Use Case**: Especially useful when more than just the relative size of a value needs to be communicated.

#### How Color Scales Work
- **Comparison**: The color of each cell is determined by how its value compares to the values in the selected range.
- **Shading**: Unlike bars, color scales use shading to visually represent the relative values within a dataset.

#### Key Features
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Enhances data interpretation by showing relationships and trends more clearly.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for a wide range of datasets, making it a versatile tool for data presentation.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Open the Conditional Formatting Dialog**: Access through Excel’s interface to begin setting up the formatting rules.
2. **Select the Appropriate Rule Type**: Choose "Format all cells based on their values" for data bars or other rule types for different scenarios.
3. **Configure the Rule**: Define the "Shortest Bar," "Longest Bar," and their respective values.
4. **Choose Display Options**: Select the "Bar Color" and preview the settings before applying them.
5. **Apply the Rule**: Finalize by clicking "OK" to apply the formatting to the selected cells.

    {
        // Writing values.
        migrantRange.ResetRowColumn(row, column);
        migrantRange.Text = "Test";
    }
}
```

#### VB.NET
```vb
' Writing Data.
Dim row As Integer

For row = 1 To rowCount Step row + 1
    Dim column As Integer
        For column = 1 To colCount Step column + 1
```

## API Reference
### IMigrantRange
The `IMigrantRange` interface is used for accessing and manipulating worksheet ranges.

#### Method: ResetRowColumn(row, column)
- Resets the focus to the specified row and column for writing operations.

for (int row = 1; row <= rowCount; row++)
{
    for (int column = 1; column <= colCount; column++)
    {
        // Writing values.
        migrantRange.ResetRowColumn(row, column);
        migrantRange.Text = "Test";
    }
}
```

### VB.NET
The example shows how to write data to a range in VB.NET.

```vb
' Writing Data.
Dim row As Integer

- Demonstrates the use of various options for text matching, including case sensitivity and entire cell content matching.
- Introduces the `FindStringStartsWith` method for searching cells that start with a specified value.

## Content

### Text Matching Examples

#### Using `FindAll` with Text

```csharp
// Find All with Simple Text and MatchEntireCellContent
IRange[] result = sheet.FindAll("Simple text", ExcelFindType.Text, ExcelFindOptions.MatchEntireCellContent);
```

```vb
' Find All with Text
Dim result() As IRange = sheet.FindAll("Simple Text", ExcelFindType.Text)

' Find All with Simple text and Match Case
Dim result() As IRange = sheet.FindAll("Simple text", ExcelFindType.Text, ExcelFindOptions.MatchCase)

' Find All with Simple Text and MatchEntireCellContent
Dim result() As IRange = sheet.FindAll("Simple text", ExcelFindType.Text, ExcelFindOptions.MatchEntireCellContent)
```

### FindStringStartsWith

The `FindStringStartsWith` method has overloads to search for the first cell that starts with the specified value. The `ExcelFindType` enumerator provides options to set the data type of the string (i.e., value and formula value) to be searched.

| **Methods**                                   | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FindStringStartsWith(String, ExcelFindType)` | These methods search for cells that start with the specified string value for the given find type. |
| `FindStringStartsWith(String, ExcelFindType, boolean)` | These methods search for cells which start with the specified string value, for the given find type and boolean value. |

#### Example in C#

```csharp
// Starts with Simple Text
IRange result = sheet.FindStringStartsWith("Sim",
```

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

```csharp
// Example in C#
// Finds all instances of "Simple text" in the sheet and matches the entire cell content.
IRange[] result = sheet.FindAll("Simple text", ExcelFindType.Text, ExcelFindOptions.MatchEntireCellContent);
```

```vb
' Example in VB
' Finds all instances of "Simple text" in the sheet with case sensitivity.
Dim result() As IRange = sheet.FindAll("Simple text", ExcelFindType.Text, ExcelFindOptions.MatchCase)
```

```csharp
// Scrolls to 40th row
sheet.TopVisibleRow = 40

// Scrolls to 7 column when opening
sheet.LeftVisibleColumn = 7
```

This is especially useful when the spreadsheet has a large number of records, and the user wants to view a particular row/column that has some details, without scrolling to that row/column after opening it. Note that these row and column indexes are "one-based."

# Essential XlsIO

## Sheet Organization

Excel has options to consolidate data from different worksheets, or move a sheet to another workbook, or insert a sheet in between the worksheets. Also, the sheet tab color can be formatted, and the sheets can be named as per the users' needs. This section explains how sheets can be organized. Below sections explain the XlsIO's ability to organize sheets.

- **Copy/Move Worksheet**  
  This section explains how a worksheet can be copied from another worksheet with or without certain formatting.
- **Sheet Format**  
  This section explains various formats that can be applied to a sheet.

### 4.1.3.3.1 Copy/Move Worksheet

When you copy/move rows and columns, Microsoft Excel copies or moves all the data that it contains, including formulas and their resulting values, comments, cell formats, and hidden cells.

#### Copying Worksheets

Copying worksheets can be internal or external. XlsIO provides support for copying a worksheet within a workbook, and also from one workbook to another. This feature can be used to merge together several workbooks. Following code example illustrates how to copy a sheet with its entire contents to another sheet.

```csharp
[C#]

// Open the Source WorkBook.
IWorkbook sourceWorkbook =
    application.Workbooks.Open(@"...\.resources\Data\SourceWorkbookTemplate.xls");

// Open the Destination WorkBook.
IWorkbook destinationWorkbook =
    application.Workbooks.Open(@"...\.resources\Data\DestinationWorkbookTemplate.xls");

// Copy the first worksheet from the Source workbook to the destination workbook.
destinationWorkbook.Worksheets.AddCopy(sourceWorkbook.Worksheets[0]);

// Activate the newly added worksheet in the destination workbook.
destinationWorkbook.ActiveSheetIndex = 1;
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Explore how to resize and position chart elements such as titles, legends, and plot areas in Excel charts.
- Address spacing issues caused by lengthy chart elements.
- Specify exact positions for chart elements in the chart area.

## Resizing and Positioning of Chart Elements

Chart elements such as chart title, legend, and plot area, can be positioned and resized easily as needed. To avoid spacing problems caused by the lengthy chart titles, plot area, or legends, the user can change the way that how these elements have to be positioned in the chart. You can also specify the exact position of the chart elements in the chart area.

The following code examples illustrate how to resize and position the chart elements.

```csharp
[C#]
' Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
' Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
IWorkbook workbook = 
application.Workbooks.Open(@"../../Data/Sample.xlsx",
ExcelOpenType.Automatic);
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
IChart chart = sheet.Charts[0];

//Manually positioning chart title
//Edge: Specifies that the width or Height will be interpreted as right
// or bottom of the chart element
//Factor: Specifies that the width or Height will be interpreted as the
// width or height of the chart element
chart.ChartTitleArea.Layout.LeftMode = LayoutModes.edge;
chart.ChartTitleArea.Layout.TopMode = LayoutModes.edge;
//Value in points should not be a negative value if LayoutMode is Edge
//It can be a negative value if the LayoutMode is Factor.
chart.ChartTitleArea.Layout.Left = 1;
chart.ChartTitleArea.Layout.Top = 20;

//Manually positioning and resizing chart plot area
//Inner: Specifies that the plot area size will determine the size of
// the plot area, without including the tick marks and axis labels
chart.PlotArea.Layout.LayoutTarget = LayoutTargets.inner;
chart.PlotArea.Layout.LeftMode = LayoutModes.edge;
chart.PlotArea.Layout.TopMode = LayoutModes.edge;
chart.PlotArea.Layout.Left = 50;
chart.PlotArea.Layout.Top = 75;
```

## API Reference
### LayoutModes
Specifies how the position or size of a chart element is interpreted.  
- **Edge**: Specifies positional measurement relative to the edge.  
- **Factor**: Specifies positional measurement relative to the width or height of the chart element.

### LayoutTargets
Specifies the target area for chart layout adjustments.  
- **Inner**: Adjusts plot area size excluding tick marks and axis labels.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- This page explains how to create and customize Sparklines using XlsIO in Excel documents.
- Focuses on the API support for Sparklines, including creation, customization, and integration into Excel spreadsheets.
- Demonstrates code examples in C# and VB for adding and configuring Sparklines.

## Content

### Sparkline Creation Using XlsIO

The Sparklines appear once you select the data range and the location range. Now you can customize the appearance of Sparklines in terms of color, style, etc. A group of Sparkline tools are available on the ribbon to change the high point, low point, color, edit the sparkline data, etc.

XlsIO provides support for creation of Sparklines by using simple APIs.

- **ISparklineGroups** interface caches the SparklineGroup that needs to be added to the Spreadsheet.
- **ISparklineGroup** represents Sparklines in an object and has properties that allow customization.
- **ISparklines** interface returns the collection of Sparkline present in a Worksheet.
- **ISparkline** represents a sparkline in the Sparklines. Currently, XlsIO supports all the three types of sparklines - Line, Column, Win/Loss which are supported in Excel 2010.

The following code example illustrates how to create Sparklines by using XlsIO.

#### Code Examples

**C#**
```csharp
ISparklineGroup sparklineGroup = sheet.SparklineGroups.Add();
sparklineGroup.SparklineType = SparklineType.Line;

ISparklines sparklines = sparklineGroup.Add();

IRange dataRange = sheet.Range["D6:G17"];
IRange referenceRange = sheet.Range["H6:H17"];

sparklines.Add(dataRange, referenceRange);
```

**VB**
```vb
Dim sparklineGroup As ISparklineGroup = sheet.SparklineGroups.Add()
sparklineGroup.SparklineType = SparklineType.Line

Dim sparklines As ISparklines = sparklineGroup.Add()

Dim dataRange As IRange = sheet.Range("D6:G17")
Dim referenceRange As IRange = sheet.Range("H6:H17")

sparklines.Add(dataRange, referenceRange)
```

# Essential XlsIO

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.DifferentOddAndEvenPagesHF = False
sheet.PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHF = False
sheet.PageSetup.HFScaleWithDoc = True
sheet.PageSetup.AlignHFWithPageMargins = True
```

## 4.2.5 Tables

In Excel, Tables can be inserted by selecting Table option from the Insert menu.

### Table Creation By Using XlsIO

XlsIO provides support to read and write tables in a spreadsheet. The table is added as an `IListObject` to the worksheet. The input data to the table must be a range of data existing in the worksheet. `IListObject` returns the collection of tables in the worksheet.

[C#]

```csharp
// Create Table
IListObject table1 = sheet.ListObjects.Create("Table1", sheet["A1:C8"]);
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
' Create Table
Dim table1 As IListObject = sheet.ListObjects.Create("Table1", sheet("A1:C8"))
```

### Total Row

You can add the "Total Row" to any table by accessing the `Table Columns`. Columns in the tables are accessed by using the index. It is possible to set "Totals Calculation" to the Total Row cells by using the `ExcelTotalsCalculation` enumerator. These cells will be updated once they are calculated.

[C#]

```csharp
// Total Row
table1.Columns[0].TotalsRowLabel = "Total";
table1.Columns[1].TotalsCalculation = ExcelTotalsCalculation.Sum;
table1.Columns[2].TotalsCalculation = ExcelTotalsCalculation.Sum;
```

### Building the PivotTable Report

Once you select a field, the PivotTable appears in the specified location. The next step is to populate the PivotTable with the necessary data fields, which are available in the PivotTable Field List on the right-hand side of the Excel interface. The fields can be dragged into specific areas of the PivotTable grid to define how the data is presented.

#### Procedures for Populating the PivotTable

1. **Select Fields from the PivotTable Field List:** Click on the fields you want to include in your report. These fields will be used to create the report.
   
2. **Drag Fields to Defined Areas:**
   - **Report Filter:** Use this area to filter the data displayed in the PivotTable based on specific criteria.
   - **Column Labels:** Drag fields here to define the columns in the PivotTable.
   - **Row Labels:** Drag fields here to define the rows in the PivotTable.
   - **Values:** Drag fields here to specify the values to be summarized or displayed in the PivotTable.

3. **Update the PivotTable:** After dragging the fields to the appropriate areas, click the "Update" button to refresh the PivotTable with the selected fields and their arrangement.

#### Example of Fields in the PivotTable Field List

The following list shows some of the fields typically available for selection in the PivotTable Field List:
- Date
- Weekday
- Region

## Overview
- This page provides an example of applying filters to pivot tables using the XlsIO library. It demonstrates how to dynamically manipulate pivot table filters and access pivot table values programmatically.

## Content

```csharp
filter.Value1 = "East"
pivotTable.Fields(1).Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Row
pivotTable.Fields(3).Axis = PivotAxisTypes.Column

Dim field As IPivotField = pivotTable.Fields(2)
pivotTable.DataFields.Add(field, "sum", PivotSubtotalTypes.Sum)
'The following code sample must be included to XlsIO layout the pivot
table 'like MS Excel.

pivotTable.Layout()
```

### Supported Elements:
1. **Apply filter value to page filter of the pivot table.**
2. **Pivot table values can be accessed dynamically.**

### Apply Filter to Pivot Table
In Microsoft Excel, filtered data of a pivot table displays only the subset of data that meet the criteria we specified. The Excel has drop-down filter arrows for report/page filter fields, row fields, and column fields. This can be achieved in **XlsIO** using the `IPivotFilters` interface.

#### Page Field Filter
The page field filter filters the pivot table based on page field items. The following code example illustrates how to apply multiple filters to the page field items.

```csharp
//Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
//Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

//Set the default version as Excel 2010.
application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;

IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("PivotCodeDate.xlsx");
```

### Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)

```csharp
void ApplyPivotTableFilter()
{
    //Step 1: Instantiate the spreadsheet creation engine.
    ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
    //Step 2: Instantiate the excel application object.
    IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;

    //Set the default version as Excel 2010.
    application.DefaultVersion = ExcelVersion.Excel2010;

    IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open("PivotCodeDate.xlsx");

    // Apply filter to the pivot table
    IPivotTable pivotTable = workbook.Worksheets["PivotTableSheet"].PivotTables["PivotTable1"];

    // Example of applying a filter
    IPivotFilter filter = pivotTable.PageFields[1].Filters.Add();
    filter.Value1 = "East";
    
    // Layout the pivot table
    pivotTable.Layout();
    
    // Save the workbook
    workbook.Save("FilteredPivotTable.xlsx");
    workbook.Close();

    // Dispose the objects
    excelEngine.Dispose();
}
```

```

### WinForms-specific conventions
- The code snippet above demonstrates basic operations within a WinForms application using the ExcelEngine API from Syncfusion.
- It involves hiding specific items, applying styles, activating sheets, saving the workbook, closing the workbook, and disposing of the engine. This sequence is typical for managing Excel interactivity and file handling in a WinForms environment.

## API Reference
- **ExcelEngine**
  - Properties:
    - `ThrowNotSavedOnDestroy`: A boolean property that determines whether an exception will be thrown for unsaved workbooks upon disposal.
  - Methods:
    - `Dispose()`: Releases all resources used by the ExcelEngine.

## Code Examples

### Example: Managing a PivotTable in Excel

#### C#

```csharp
// Assuming colField, pivotTable, pivotSheet, and workbook are properly initialized
colField.Items(0).Visible = False;
colField.Items(1).Visible = False;

// Apply a built-in style to the pivot table
pivotTable.BuiltInStyle = PivotBuiltInStyles.PivotStyleMedium2;

// Activate the pivot worksheet
pivotSheet.Activate();

// Save the workbook to disk
workbook.SaveAs("PivotTable.xlsx");

// Close the workbook
workbook.Close();

// Prevent an exception for unsaved workbooks during disposal
excelEngine.ThrowNotSavedOnDestroy = False;

// Dispose of the ExcelEngine resources
excelEngine.Dispose();
```

#### VB.NET

```vb
' Assuming colField, pivotTable, pivotSheet, and workbook are properly initialized
colField.Items(0).Visible = False
colField.Items(1).Visible = False

' Apply a built-in style to the pivot table
pivotTable.BuiltInStyle = PivotBuiltInStyles.PivotStyleMedium2

' Activate the pivot worksheet
pivotSheet.Activate()

' Save the workbook to disk
workbook.SaveAs("PivotTable.xlsx")

' Close the workbook
workbook.Close()

' Prevent an exception for unsaved workbooks during disposal
excelEngine.ThrowNotSavedOnDestroy = False

' Dispose of the ExcelEngine resources
excelEngine.Dispose()
```

### PivotChart Creation Using XlslO

XlslO provides support for the creation of PivotTables and PivotCharts by using simple code samples. IPivotCache interface caches the data that need to be summarized when filtering. IPivotTable represents a PivotTable in object, and has properties that allow customizing it. IPivotTable interface returns the collection of PivotTables that are present in a worksheet. IPivotField represents the field in the PivotTable. This includes row, column and data field axes. IPivotDataFields get a collection of the data field and once the PivotTable is created, it is required to create a PivotChart by setting the PivotSource property of the IChart interface, which references the created PivotTable.

#### Note: PivotTable and PivotChart are currently not supported for .xls format.
The following code example illustrates the creation of a PivotTable and PivotChart by using XlslO.

### Manipulating Combo Boxes in Excel Spreadsheets

```csharp
// Select an item.
comboBox1.SelectedIndex = 6;

// Read a Combo Box.
IComboBoxShape comboBox2 = sheet.ComboBoxes[0];
comboBox2.SelectedIndex = 3;
```

#### VB.NET Example

```vb
' Create a Combo Box.
Dim comboBox1 As IComboBoxShape = sheet.ComboBoxes.AddComboBox(27, 5, 20, 100)

' Assign a value to the Combo Box.
comboBox1.ListFillRange = sheet("A1:A12")
comboBox1.LinkedCell = sheet("C3")

' Select an item.
comboBox1.SelectedIndex = 6

' Read a Combo Box.
Dim comboBox2 As IComboBoxShape = sheet.ComboBoxes(0)
comboBox2.SelectedIndex = 3
```

### Visual Representation

### Explanation
- **Creating a Combo Box**: The code demonstrates how to add a combo box to an Excel spreadsheet using `AddComboBox` with specified parameters for position, size, and other properties.
- **Assigning Values**: The `ListFillRange` property links the combo box to a range of cells to populate its dropdown list. The `LinkedCell` property ensures changes in the combo box are reflected in the specified linked cell.
- **Selecting an Item**: The `SelectedIndex` property is used to set or retrieve the currently selected item in the combo box.

## API Reference

### Classes and Methods
- **XlsIO**: The main library for manipulating Excel files.
- **IComboBoxShape**: Interface for working with combo box controls in Excel.
  - **AddComboBox(x, y, width, height)**: Creates a new combo box at the specified coordinates and dimensions.
  - **ListFillRange**: Sets the range of cells that populate the combo box's dropdown list.
  - **LinkedCell**: Links the selected item in the combo box to a specific cell.
  - **SelectedIndex**: Gets or sets the index of the currently selected item in the combo box.

## Code Examples

### C#

```csharp
using Syncfusion.XlsIO;
// Create a new instance of the Excel engine.
var excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();
// Access the XlsIO application instance.
IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Create();

// Access the first worksheet.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Add a combo box to the worksheet.
IComboBoxShape comboBox1 = sheet.ComboBoxes.AddComboBox(200, 50, 100, 30);

// Populate the combo box from a range of cells.
comboBox1.ListFillRange = sheet.Range["A1:A10"];
comboBox1.LinkedCell = sheet.Range["C1"];
comboBox1.SelectedIndex = 3;

// Save the workbook and dispose of resources.
workbook.SaveAs("ComboBoxExample.xlsx");
workbook.Close();
exceEngine.Dispose();
```

### VB.NET

```vb
Imports Syncfusion.XlsIO
' Create a new instance of the Excel engine.
Dim excelEngine As New ExcelEngine()
' Access the XlsIO application instance.
Dim application As IApplication = excelEngine.Excel
Dim workbook As IWorkbook = application.Workbooks.Create()

' Access the first worksheet.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

' Add a combo box to the worksheet.
Dim comboBox1 As IComboBoxShape = sheet.ComboBoxes.AddComboBox(200, 50, 100, 30)

' Populate the combo box from a range of cells.
comboBox1.ListFillRange = sheet.Range("A1:A10")
comboBox1.LinkedCell = sheet.Range("C1")
comboBox1.SelectedIndex = 3

' Save the workbook and dispose of resources.
workbook.SaveAs("ComboBoxExample.xlsx")
workbook.Close()
exceEngine.Dispose()
```

## Content

### Orientation

- **While creating small worksheets**, it is not necessary to change the direction/orientation of the pages, but some worksheets and charts require the width of the pages to be greater than its length.

- **Similar to the landscape painting**, whose width is greater than the length, Landscape page orientation enables you to fit wider items on a page. A page, whose width is greater than the length, is called a Portrait orientation, like portraits of people.

- **Excel allows to change the orientation of the page**, through the Page Setup dialog box. It allows to change the orientation to Landscape or Portrait.

## Page-level Navigation/TOC (if applicable)

- **Orientation**

## API Reference (if applicable)

- **Details about Page Setup**
  - The Page Setup dialog box allows adjustment of the orientation to either Landscape or Portrait.

## Code Examples (multi-language supported)
- **Illustrative example**:
  ```csharp
  // Example code may include setting up page orientation in C#
  worksheet.PageSetup.Orientation = Orientation.Landscape;
  ```

## Cross References
- **See also:** Documentation on Adjustment Settings, Page Layout.

# Essential XlsIO

Page Breaks are dividers that break a worksheet into separate pages for printing. To print a worksheet with the exact number of pages that you want, you can adjust the page breaks in the worksheet before you print it. Excel inserts automatic page breaks, based on the paper size, margin settings, scaling options, and the positions of any manual page breaks that you insert, and it also allows to insert/remove breaks at preferred locations.

![Image showing the "Insert menu -> Page Break" option](#fig-112)

Figure 112: Insert menu -> Page Break

XLsIO provides support for inserting/removing Horizontal and Vertical page breaks in a worksheet by using the `IHPagebreak` and `IVPagebreak` interfaces.

**Note:** By default, page breaks are not shown in the Normal view. However, you can view them by inserting new page breaks.

```csharp
// Entering text into the cells.
sheet.Range["A1:M20"].Text = "PageBreak";

// Giving Horizontal Page Breaks.
sheet.HPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["A5"]);
sheet.HPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["A10"]);
sheet.HPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["A15"]);

// Giving Vertical Page Breaks.
sheet.VPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["B5"]);
sheet.VPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["E10"]);
sheet.VPageBreaks.Add(sheet.Range["K15"]);
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Demonstrates how to set a background image using XlsIO.
- Provides information on scaling a worksheet to fit on a page.

## Content

### Figure 114: Setting Background Image Using XlsIO

The image above shows an Excel worksheet with a background image example.

#### 4.3.2 Scale To Fit

Scaling lets you specify a certain percentage to reduce or enlarge your worksheet. The "Fit to" Page feature allows you to force the worksheet to print on a specific number of pages, without having to calculate the percentage yourself.

When you need to print a worksheet that is too large to fit on the page, without making the font very small, you can use the Orientation and Scaling features.

Excel enables this feature through the Page Setup dialog box.

## API Reference

Not applicable in this example as no specific API references are mentioned.

# Essential XlsIO

## Navigation and Headers

Row and column headings are the row numbers and the column letters. Checking the box enables them to print in MS Excel. XlsIO has the option to enable/disable headings through the **PrintHeadings** property of IPageSetup. Remember, headings are not the same as the labels created.

## Color

Excel allows setting the colors for printing. You can print a sheet without colors by using the **BlackAndWhite** property of the **IPageSetup** interface in XlsIO.

## Quality

Excel provides options to toggle the quality by using the "DraftQuality" option. Draft quality is a fast, but not a crisp print quality. XlsIO allows to enable this option through the **Draft** property of the IPageSetup interface. You can also set the print quality that controls the dpi by using the **PrintQuality** property.

## Comments

Comments are little notes that you can attach to cells. They can be printed all together at the end of the sheet, or within the sheet, or not at all. This can be set through XlsIO by using the **PrintNotes** property.

## Page Order

Excel allows to set the page order in which the sections of a worksheet should be printed, when it does not fit on one paper page. The default option is **DownThenOver**. The other option, **OverThenDown**, prints the cells across the top of the sheet, first, and then moves down to print the next set of rows.

XlsIO allows to set the print direction as illustrated in the following code example.

### Code Example

```csharp
[C#]
// Set direction of printing.
workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup.Order = ExcelOrder.DownThenOver;
```

```vb.net
[VB.NET]
```

## API Reference

### Properties
- **PrintHeadings**: Enables or disables row and column headings in print output.
- **BlackAndWhite**: Allows printing a sheet without colors.
- **Draft**: Enables draft-quality printing.
- **PrintQuality**: Controls the dpi of the print quality.
- **PrintNotes**: Controls the printing of comments.

### Methods
No specific methods are documented in this excerpt.

## Code Examples

See the provided C# example to set the print order direction.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Explains how the Automatic and Manual Calculation modes in Excel work and their impact on recalculating open workbooks.
- Describes the settings for Iteration, Workbook options, and manual calculation requests in the Options Dialog Box.
- Details scenarios where recalculations are particularly important or noticeable.

## Content

### Automatic Calculation

**Figure 120: Options Dialog Box- Calculation**

In the Automatic Calculation mode, Excel automatically recalculates all open workbooks at each and every change and whenever you open a workbook.

Usually when you open a workbook in Automatic mode, and recalculating is done, you will not be able to see the recalculating, because the changes will not be reflected until the workbook is saved. An exception is when you open a workbook in Excel 2000 that was saved by using Excel 97, or open a workbook by using Excel 2002/2003 saved by using Excel 2000. This is because Excel's calculation engines are different, and also because a Full calculation is done.

### Manual Calculation

In the Manual Calculation mode, Excel will only recalculate all open workbooks when you request it by pressing F9 or CTRL-ALT-F9, or when you Save a workbook. For workbooks taking more than a fraction of a second to recalculate, it is usually better to set the Calculation to "Manual".

Excel tells you when the workbook needs recalculating, by showing Calculate in the status bar.

# Overview
- Demonstrates accessing and manipulating worksheet objects and ranges using defined names in a workbook.
- Highlights creating dynamic formulas using names in an Excel worksheet.
- Provides code examples in both C# and VB.NET to implement these functionalities.

## Content

### Example: Using Defined Names in Formulas

In this example, we illustrate how to access the first worksheet, define ranges using named references, and use these names in a formula to calculate a sum.

#### C#

```csharp
// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
IWorksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Defining the Range and using it in the Formula.
IName lname1 = workbook.Names.Add("One");
lname1.RefersToRange = sheet.Range["C3"];

IName lname2 = workbook.Names.Add("Two");
lname2.RefersToRange = sheet.Range["D3"];

// Formula using Defined Names.
sheet.Range["E3"].Formula = "=SUM(One,Two)";
```

#### VB.NET

```vb.net
' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection is accessed.
Dim sheet As IWorksheet = workbook.Worksheets(0)

' Defining the Range and using it in the Formula.
Dim lname1 As IName = workbook.Names.Add("One")
lname1.RefersToRange = sheet.Range("C3")

Dim lname2 As IName = workbook.Names.Add("Two")
lname2.RefersToRange = sheet.Range("D3")

' Formula using Defined Names.
sheet.Range("E3").Formula = "=SUM(One,Two)"
```

### Explanation

1. **Accessing the Worksheet**:
   - The first worksheet is accessed from the `Worksheets` collection using `workbook.Worksheets[0]` in C# or `workbook.Worksheets(0)` in VB.NET.

2. **Defining Named Ranges**:
   - Two named ranges are created:
     - `One` referring to the range `C3`.
     - `Two` referring to the range `D3`.
   - These named ranges are added to the workbook using the `Names.Add` method.

3. **Using Named Ranges in a Formula**:
   - A formula is then assigned to cell `E3` using the `Formula` property of the range object.
   - The formula `=SUM(One, Two)` calculates the sum of the values in the ranges `C3` and `D3`, which are represented by the defined names `One` and `Two`.

This approach allows for more dynamic and maintainable formulas within Excel workbooks by using named ranges instead of hardcoding cell references.

# Error Checking

## Overview
- Excel offers error-checking rules that can be enabled or disabled to display green indicators for warnings.

## Content

In this section, we will discuss the various error-checking rules available in Excel that can help identify and flag potential issues within your worksheet. Below are the detailed descriptions and scenarios for each rule:

### Key Rules for Error Checking

#### 1. Evaluates to Error Value
- This rule treats cells containing formulas that result in an error.
- It displays a warning in such cases.

#### 2. Text Date
- This rule treats formulas that contain text-formatted cells with years represented as 2-digits as an error.
- It displays a warning while checking for errors.

#### 3. Number Stored as Text
- This rule treats numbers formatted as text or preceded by an apostrophe as an error.
- It displays a warning in these scenarios.

#### 4. Inconsistent Formula in Region
- This rule treats a formula in a region of your worksheet that differs from the other formulas in the same region as an error.
- It displays a warning to indicate inconsistency.

#### 5. Formula Omits Cells in Region
- This rule treats formulas that omit certain cells in a region as an error.
- It displays a warning when such formulas are encountered.

#### 6. Unlocked Cells Containing Formulas
- This rule treats an unlocked cell containing a formula as an error.
- It displays a warning when checking for errors.

#### 7. Formulas Referring to Empty Cells
- This rule treats formulas that refer to empty cells as an error.
- It displays a warning when such occurrences are identified.

### Visual Representation

![](Figure 126: Error Checking)
**Figure 126:** Error Checking

The above figure shows an example of error-checking options in Excel, where the user has the option to convert a number stored as text into a numerical format or explore further options such as error handling and formula auditing.

### Summary

These error-checking rules in Excel are vital for maintaining data integrity and identifying potential issues within your spreadsheets. By enabling or disabling these rules as needed, you can tailor the error-checking experience to suit your specific needs and ensure accurate and reliable data handling.

Set up data validation rules in Excel spreadsheets. The following examples demonstrate how to apply data validation for numbers and dates.

```csharp
validation1.AllowType = ExcelDataType.Integer
validation1.CompareOperator = ExcelDataValidationComparisonOperator.Between
validation1.FirstFormula = "0"
validation1.SecondFormula = "10"
validation1.ShowErrorBox = True
validation1.ErrorBoxText = "Enter Value between 0 to 10"
validation1.ErrorBoxTitle = "ERROR"
validation1.PromptBoxText = "Data Validation using Condition for Numbers"
validation1.ShowPromptBox = True
```

```csharp
' Data Validation for Date.
Dim validation2 As IDataValidation = sheet.Range("A5").DataValidation
sheet.Range("A5").Text = "Enter the Date"
validation2.AllowType = ExcelDataType.Date
validation2.CompareOperator = ExcelDataValidationComparisonOperator.Between
validation2.FirstDateTime = New DateTime(2003,5,10)
validation2.SecondDateTime = New DateTime(2004,5,10)
validation2.ShowErrorBox = True
validation2.ErrorBoxText = "Enter Value between 10/5/2003 to 10/5/2004"
validation2.ErrorBoxTitle = "ERROR"
validation2.PromptBoxText = "Data Validation using Condition for Date"
validation2.ShowPromptBox = True
```

#### Reading the Existing Data Validation Settings

You can also read the Data Validation settings in an existing workbook. The following code example illustrates this.

##### C#

```csharp
// Reading the Data Validation list.
this.comboBox1.Items.AddRange(sheet.Range["A1"].DataValidation.ListOfValues);
```

##### VB.NET

```vb
' Reading the Data Validation list.
Me.comboBox1.Items.AddRange(sheet.Range("A1").DataValidation.ListOfValues)
```

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- XlsIO allows scrolling to the first row in the bottom pane and first column in the right pane with freeze panes.
- Split Panes feature enables viewing multiple copies of the worksheet and scrolling independently in each pane.
- HorizontalSplit and VerticalSplit properties are provided for splitting the window.

## Content

### Freeze Pane Navigation

**Figure 148: XlsIO with Freeze Pane**

XlsIO also allows you to scroll to the first row in the bottom pane and first column in the right pane. It helps you to navigate to the top row while opening a spreadsheet with a large number of rows/columns. Note that this works only with the sheet that has the freeze panes.

#### Code Example: Setting Visible Panes

##### C#

```csharp
// Sets first visible row in the bottom pane.
sheet.FirstVisibleRow = 2;

// Sets first visible column in the right pane.
sheet.FirstVisibleColumn = 2;
```

##### VB.NET

```vbnet
' Sets first visible row in the bottom pane.
sheet.FirstVisibleRow = 2

' Sets first visible column in the right pane.
sheet.FirstVisibleColumn = 2
```

**Note:** FirstVisibleColumn and FirstVisibleRow indexes are "zero-based".

### Split Pane

#### Subsection: 4.7.1.2 Split Pane

A very handy feature of Excel is its ability to view more than one copy of your worksheet, and scroll through each pane of your worksheet independently. You can do this by using a feature called Split Panes, which can be used to split your worksheet both horizontally and vertically. This is enabled in MS Excel by selecting the Split option from the Window menu.

While using Split Panes, the panes of your worksheet work simultaneously. If you make a change in one, it will simultaneously appear in the other.

XlsIO provides support for splitting the window through the HorizontalSplit and VerticalSplit properties. Following code example illustrates this.

### Code Example: Splitting the Window

**C#**

```csharp
// Code to be added here for HorizontalSplit and VerticalSplit properties
```

# Essential XlsIO

- Sheet Tabs

## Grid Lines

Some users may find it easier to work with your worksheet applications, if they cannot see the grid lines. Excel provides options to show/hide grid lines in the worksheet. This is done by accessing the GridLines option by opening the Tools menu, pointing to Option, and then selecting GridLines.

XlsIO provides support for this feature through the IsGridLine property of IWorksheet. Color for the grid line can also be set through the GridLineColor property of IWorksheet.

### Example: Hiding Grid Lines

```csharp
// Hides grid line.
sheet.IsGridLinesVisible = false;
```

```vb
' Hides grid line.
sheet.IsGridLinesVisible = False
```

## Headings

Headings are the display labels in worksheets that enable users to find out the cell number with ease. You can show/hide these headings by using the IsRowColumnHeadersVisible property of IWorksheet.

### Example: Hiding Row and Column Headers

```csharp
sheet.IsRowColumnHeadersVisible = false;
```

```vb
sheet.IsRowColumnHeadersVisible = False
```

## API Reference

- **IsGridLine** (Property): Indicates whether the grid lines are visible in the worksheet.
- **GridLineColor** (Property): Specifies the color of the grid lines in the worksheet.
- **IsRowColumnHeadersVisible** (Property): Controls the visibility of row and column headings in the worksheet.

# Essential XlsIO

## Overview
- Excel features for preparing and securing documents for sharing and distribution.
- Focus on Document Properties and Encryption/Decryption through XlsIO.
- Includes code examples for setting Built-In and Custom properties.

## Content

### 4.8 Prepare

Excel provides various features to prepare a document for sharing and distribution. These features help the users to add details on their report and share them in a secured way.

This section elaborates on the following features that play a vital role in preparing an Excel spreadsheet for distribution.

- **Document Properties**  
  This topic explains the various document properties that can be added to a workbook through XlsIO.

- **Encryption and Decryption**  
  This topic explains the workbook encryption and decryption with password through XlsIO.

#### 4.8.1 Document Properties

Document Properties are named values that provide information about the document, such as the date and time at which the document was last saved, the last user to modify the document, and so on. Document Properties are either built into the document, or are custom user-defined properties.

You can read, and manually add or modify some Built-In properties, and all Custom properties, by selecting the properties from the File menu. Built-in properties can be automatically updated properties such as LastSaveDate, or preset properties such as Keywords.

XlsIO allows to read and write Built-In and Custom properties through the IBuiltinDocumentProperties and ICustomDocumentProperties.

The following code example illustrates how to set the spreadsheet's Built-In and Custom properties.

```csharp
// Setting Built-in Document Properties.
IBuiltinDocumentProperties builtInProperites = book.BuiltinDocumentProperties;
builtInProperites.Author = "Essential XlsIO";
builtInProperites.Comments = "This document was generated using Essential XlsIO";
builtInProperites.ByteCount = 120;
builtInProperites.LastSaveDate = new DateTime(1950, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
builtInProperites.Manager = "Manager";

// Setting Custom Properties.
```

The Range and CopyTo methods include overloads for copying the Source Worksheet range to the Destination Worksheet range. The following code example illustrates how to copy a range from one workbook to another workbook.

- **C# Example:**

```csharp
// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection in the Source
// Workbook is accessed.
IWorksheet SourceWorksheet = SourceWorkbook.Worksheets[0];

// The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection in the
// Destination Workbook is accessed.
IWorksheet DestinationWorksheet = DestinationWorkbook.Worksheets[0];

// Assigning an object to the range of cells (90 rows) both for source and
// destination.
IRange source = SourceWorksheet.Range[1, 1, 90, 100];
IRange des = DestinationWorksheet.Range[1, 1, 90, 100];

// Copying (90 rows) from Source to Destination worksheet.
source.CopyTo(des);
```

- **VB.NET Example:**

```vb
' The first worksheet object in the worksheets collection in the Source
' Workbook is accessed.
Dim SourceWorksheet As Syncfusion.XlsIO.IWorksheet =

# Essential XlsIO

However, there is often a need to protect only certain cells in a worksheet. In this scenario, you need to protect a worksheet, and set the `IsLocked` property to `false` for the cells that need to be made editable.

## Protecting Specific Cells

[C#]

```csharp
// Sample data
sheetOne.Range["A1:K20"].Text = "Locked";

// A1:A10 will not be protected.
sheetOne.Range["A1:A10"].CellStyle.Locked = false;
sheetOne.Range["A1:A10"].Text = "UnLocked";
sheetOne.Protect("syncfusion", ExcelSheetProtection.FormattingColumns);
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
' Sample data
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:K20").Text = "Locked"

' A1:A10 will not be protected.
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:A10").CellStyle.Locked = False
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:A10").Text = "UnLocked"
sheetOne.Protect("syncfusion", ExcelSheetProtection.FormattingColumns)
```

>Note: Locking/Unlocking cells in an unprotected worksheet has no effect.

## 5.1.9 How to save a file to stream?

XlsIO provides support to save a spreadsheet to a .NET stream. The following code example illustrates this.

[C#]

```csharp
// Save the workbook to stream.
FileStream fs = new FileStream("FileStreamSample.xls", FileMode.Create,
 FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.ReadWrite);
workbook.SaveAs(fs);
workbook.Close();
```

[VB.NET]

```vb
' Sample data
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:K20").Text = "Locked"

' A1:A10 will not be protected.
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:A10").CellStyle.Locked = False
Private sheetOne.Range("A1:A10").Text = "UnLocked"
sheetOne.Protect("syncfusion", ExcelSheetProtection.FormattingColumns)
```
